# Trapperdata and other datasets of threat entities Recognize

The complete Trapperdata dataset contains 10 categories of threat entities with a total
of 16,476 threat entity annotations. Additionally, Trapperdata is a threat entity dataset that we annotated
with recently collected threat intelligence. 

The complete DNRTI dataset contains 13 categories of threat entities with a total of 36,412 threat
entity annotations. 

The CTI dataset contains 4 types of threat entities with a
total of 15720 threat entity annotations. 

Due to the different classification granularity and naming of threat
entities, it is difficult to unify the classification of threat entities in different datasets. In this task, we focus
on recognizing 6 types of threat entities, namely Hack Organization, Attack Tool, vulnerability, Hash, IP,
URL, and make corresponding changes to the naming in the DNRTI and CTI datasets that have the
same meaning as these 6 types of entities to adapt them to the task.
