Unit O
42 O
believes O
this O
group B-HackOrg
is O
previously O
unidentified O
and O
therefore O
have O
we O
have O
dubbed O
it O
" O
RANCOR B-HackOrg
" O
. O

The O
Rancor B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
's O
attacks O
use O
two O
primary O
malware O
families O
which O
we O
describe O
in O
depth O
later O
in O
this O
blog O
and O
are O
naming O
DDKONG B-Tool
and O
PLAINTEE B-Tool
. O

We O
identified O
decoy O
files O
which O
indicate O
these O
attacks O
began O
with O
spear O
phishing O
messages O
but O
have O
not O
observed O
the O
actual O
messages O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Rancor B-HackOrg
attackers B-HackOrg
were O
targeting O
political O
entities O
. O

Additionally O
, O
these O
decoy O
documents O
are O
hosted O
on O
legitimate O
websites O
including O
a O
government O
website O
belonging O
to O
the O
Cambodia O
Government O
and O
in O
at O
least O
once O
case O
, O
Facebook O
. O

Our O
Investigation O
into O
both O
clusters O
further O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
both O
involved O
in O
attacks O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
South O
East O
Asia O
. O

We O
observed O
DDKONG B-Tool
in O
use O
between O
February O
2017 O
and O
the O
present O
, O
while O
PLAINTEE B-Tool
is O
a O
newer O
addition O
with O
the O
earliest O
known O
sample O
being O
observed O
in O
October O
2017 O
. O

The O
RANCOR O
campaign O
represents O
a O
continued O
trend O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
entities O
within O
the O
South O
East O
Asia O
region O
. O

They O
are O
interested O
in O
users O
of O
remote O
banking O
systems O
( O
RBS O
) O
, O
mainly O
in O
Russia O
and O
neighboring O
countries O
. O

That O
this O
group B-HackOrg
is O
mostly O
targeting O
businesses O
is O
apparent O
from O
the O
processes O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
on O
a O
compromised O
system O
. O

While O
both O
RTM B-Tool
and O
Buhtrap B-Tool
are O
looking O
for O
a O
quite O
similar O
process O
list O
, O
the O
infection O
vectors O
are O
quite O
different O
. O

This O
group B-HackOrg
has O
used O
a O
large O
array O
of O
infection O
vectors O
, O
mostly O
revolving O
around O
drive-by O
downloads O
and O
spam O
. O

They O
are O
both O
targeting O
businesses O
using O
accounting O
software O
, O
are O
fingerprinting O
systems O
of O
interest O
similarly O
, O
are O
looking O
for O
smart O
card O
readers O
, O
and O
finally O
, O
they O
deploy O
an O
array O
of O
malicious O
tools O
to O
spy O
on O
their O
victims O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
we O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
samples O
SHA-1 O
AA0FA4584768CE9E16D67D8C529233E99FF1BBF0 O
and O
48BC113EC8BA20B8B80CD5D4DA92051A19D1032B O
. O

Despite O
its O
known O
weaknesses O
, O
the O
RC4 B-Tool
algorithm O
is O
regularly O
used O
by O
malware O
authors O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
use O
of O
the O
relatively O
unique O
PLAINTEE B-Tool

, O
the O

use O
of O
the O
same O
file O
paths O
on O
in O
each O
cluster O
, O
and O
the O
similar O
targeting O
, O
we O
have O
grouped O
these O
attacks O
together O
under O
the O
RANCOR O
campaign O
moniker O
. O

Bdo O
is O
the O
Russian O
translation O
for O
RBS O
( O
Remote O
Banking O
System O
) O
so O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
RBS O
is O
a O
target O
for O
this O
malware O
. O

Other O
groups B-HackOrg
, O
such O
as O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
, O
Corkow B-HackOrg
and O
Carbanak B-HackOrg
, O
were O
already O
known O
to O
target O
and O
successfully O
steal O
money O
from O
financial O
institutions O
and O
their O
customers O
in O
Russia O
. O

Our O
research O
on O
the O
RTM B-Tool
malware I-Tool
shows O
that O
the O
Russian O
banking O
system O
is O
still O
a O
target O
of O
choice O
for O
criminals B-HackOrg

In O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
, O
BlackEnergy B-HackOrg
caught O
our O
attention O
when O

In O
the O
summer O

we O
noted O
that O
certain O

has O
a O
significant O
interest O
in O
both O

those O
interested O
in O
critiques O

Using O
these O
tactics O
Scarlet B-HackOrg

four O
years O
using O
a O

that O
has O
been O
under O
active O

Based O
on O
analysis O
of O
the O
data O
and O
malware O
samples O
we O
have O
collected O
, O
Unit O

believes O
the O

are O
the O
work O
of O
a O
group B-HackOrg

In O
the O
past O

Scarlet B-HackOrg
Mimic I-HackOrg
has O
primarily O
targeted O
individuals O
who O
belong O
to O
these O
minority O

but O
we've O
recently O
found O
evidence O
to O
indicate O
the O

also O
targets O
individuals O
working O
inside O
government O
anti-terrorist O
organizations O

We O
also O
know O
Scarlet B-HackOrg
Mimic I-HackOrg

Pony B-Tool
is O
a O
fairly O
common O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
existed O
in O
various O
forms O
since O
2012 O
, O
with O
our O
first O
indications O
of O
Nigerian O
use O
occurring O
in O
August O
2014 O
. O

Of O
the O
four O
, O
KeyBase B-Tool
stands O
out O
due O
to O
its O
rapid O
rise O
in O
popularity O
, O
with O
a O
peak O
deployment O
of O
160 O
samples O
per O
month O
and O

Unit O
42 O
analyzed O
the O

of O
these O
six O
malware O

and O
found O
that O
Nigerian O
actors B-HackOrg
are O
currently O
producing O

average O
of O
146 O
unique O
samples O
of O
malware O
per O
month O
( O
see O
Figure O

) O
. O

Given O
this O
requirement O
, O
SilverTerrier B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
often O
rely O
on O
Dynamic B-Tool
DNS I-Tool
and O
virtual B-Tool
private I-Tool
servers I-Tool
to O
provide O
a O
layer O
of O
obfuscation O
to O
protect O
their O

When O
using O
email O

, O
SilverTerrier B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
preferred O
to O
use O
large O
target O
audiences O
, O
which O
maximized O
the O
likelihood O
of O
success O
with O
very O
little O
risk O
. O

Unit O

roughly O
300 O
SilverTerrier B-HackOrg

combined O
11,600 O

To O
that O

it O
is O
very O
unlikely O
that O
the O
United O

Earlier O
this O

an O
advanced O
, O
persistent O

targeting O
telecommunications O
providers O
that O
has O
been O
underway O
for O
years O
, O
soon O
after O
deploying O
into O
the O
environment O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
data O
available O
to O
us O
, O
Operation O
Soft O
Cell O
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O
least O
2012 O
, O
though O
some O
evidence O
suggests O
even O
earlier O
activity O
by O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
against O
telecommunications O
providers O
. O

Threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
, O
especially O
those O
at O
the O
level O
of O
nation O
state O
, O
are O
seeking O
opportunities O
to O
attack O
these O
organizations O
, O
conducting O
elaborate O
, O
advanced O
operations O
to O
gain O
leverage O
, O
seize O
strategic O
assets O
, O
and O
collect O
information O
. O

The O
tools O
and O
techniques O
used O
throughout O
these O
attacks O
are O
consistent O
with O
several O
Chinese O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
, O
such O
as O
APT10 B-HackOrg
, O
a O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
believed O
to O
operate O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Chinese O
Ministry O
of O
State O
Security O
. O

The O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
attempted O
to O
compromise O
critical O
assets O
, O
such O
as O
database O
servers O
, O
billing O
servers O
, O
and O
the O
active O

. O

The O
attack O
began O
with O
a O
web B-Tool
shell I-Tool
running O
on O
a O
vulnerable O
, O
publicly-facing O
server O
, O
from O
which O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
gathered O
information O
about O
the O
network O
and O
propagated O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
initial O
indicator O
of O
the O
attack O
was O
a O
malicious O
web O
shell O
that O
was O
detected O
on O
an O
IIS O
server O
, O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
w3wp.exe O
process O
. O

An O
investigation O
of O
the O
web O
shell O
, O
later O
classified O
as O
a O
modified O
version O
of O
the O
China B-Tool
Chopper I-Tool
web I-Tool
shell I-Tool
, O
uncovered O
several O
attack O
phases O
and O
TTPs O
. O

The O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
was O
able O
to O
leverage O
the O
web B-Tool
shell I-Tool
to O
run O
reconnaissance O
commands O
, O
steal O
credentials O
, O
and O
deploy O
other O
tools O
. O

The O
web O
shell O
parameters O
in O
this O
attack O
match O
to O
the O
China B-HackOrg
Chopper I-HackOrg
parameters O
, O
as O
described O
in O
FireEye O
's O
analysis O
of O
China B-HackOrg
Chopper I-HackOrg
. O

It O
is O
used O
to O
remotely O
control O
web O
servers O
, O
and O
has O
been O
used O
in O
many O
attacks O
against O
Australian O
web O
hosting O
providers O
. O

This O
tool O
has O
been O
used O
by O
several O
Chinese-affiliated O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
, O
such O
as O
APT B-HackOrg
27 I-HackOrg
and O
APT B-HackOrg
40 I-HackOrg
. O

The O
most O
common O
credential O
stealing O
tool O
used O
by O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
was O
a O
modified O
mimikatz B-Tool
that O
dumps O
NTLM O
hashes O
. O

The O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
relied O
on O
WMI B-Tool
and O
PsExec B-Tool
to O
move O
laterally O
and O
install O
their O
tools O
across O
multiple O
assets O
. O

Nbtscan B-Tool
has O
been O
used O
by O
APT10 B-HackOrg
in O
Operation O
Cloud O

to O
search O
for O
services O
of O
interest O
across O
the O
IT O

endpoints O
of O
interest O
. O

A O
second O
method O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
used O
to O
maintain O
access O
across O
the O
compromised O
assets O
was O
through O
the O
deployment O
of O
the O
PoisonIvy B-Tool
RAT I-Tool
( O
PIVY B-Tool

This O
trend O
continued O
until O
late O
September O
2017 O
, O
when O
we O
saw O
Magnitude B-Tool
EK I-Tool
focus O
primarily O
on O
the O
APAC O
region O
, O
with O
a O
large O
chunk O
targeting O
South O
Korea O

These O
ransomware B-Tool

only O
seem O
to O
target O
Korean O
systems O
, O
since O
they O
won’t O
execute O
if O
the O
system O
language O

. O

The O
malware O
was O
initially O
distributed O
through O
a O
compromised O
software O
update O
system O
and O
then O
self-propagated O
through O
stolen O

including O
the O
EternalBlue B-Tool
exploit I-Tool
used O
in O
the O
WannaCry B-HackOrg

from O
May O
2017 O
. O

In O

The O
malware O
leverages O
an O
exploit O
, O
codenamed O
EternalBlue” B-Exp
, O
that O
was O
released O
by O
the O
Shadow B-HackOrg
Brokers I-HackOrg
on O
April O
14 O
, O
2017 O
. O

The O
malware O
appends O
encrypted O
data O
files O
with O
the O
.WCRY O
extension O
, O
drops O
and O
executes O
a O
decryptor O
tool O
, O
and O
demands O
$300 O
or O
$600 O
USD O
(via O
Bitcoin) O
to O
decrypt O
the O

. O

The O
malware O
then O
builds O
two O
DLLs O
in O
memory O
– O
they O
are O
32 O
and O
64-bit O
DLLs O
that O
have O
identical O
functionality O
. O

The O
malware O
continues O
by O
creating O
a O

named O
mssecsvc2.0 O
with O
a O
binary O

We O
recently O
observed O
a O

roughly O
90 O
phony O

In O
this O
blog O
we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
crime B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
that O
specializes O
in O
payment O
card O
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye O
Labs O
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising O
payment O
card O
processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate O
further O
card O
information O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group B-HackOrg
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-Tool
, O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove O
any O
evidence O
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
is O
changing O
their O
system's O
MAC O
Address O
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors B-HackOrg
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-Tool
MAC I-Tool
Address I-Tool
Changer I-Tool
. O

We O
have O
observed O
these O
actors B-HackOrg
using O
Tor B-Tool
or O
proxy-based B-Tool
tools I-Tool
similar O
to O
Tor O
(e.g O
, O
UltraSurf O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O
2) O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them O
using O
virtual O
private O
network O
services O
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure O
anonymity O
and O
obfuscate O
criminal O
operations O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
group B-HackOrg
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Payment O
card O
dumps O
are O
commonly O
shared O
amongst O
Brazilian O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
via O
social O
media O
forums O
such O
as O
Facebook O
, O
Skype O
, O
and O
web-based O
WhatsApp O
messenger O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group B-HackOrg
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email B-Tool
credentials I-Tool
, O
personal B-Tool
information I-Tool
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime O
forums O
for O
fraud O
purposes O
. O

These O
actors B-HackOrg
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly O
access O
databases O
. O

They B-HackOrg
most O
commonly O
target O
Brazilian O
merchants O
, O
though O
others O
use O
the O
same O
tactics O
to O
exploit O
entities O
outside O
Brazil O
. O

The O
group B-HackOrg
also O
uses O
the O
SQL B-Tool
injection I-Tool
(SQLi) O
tools O
Havij O
Advanced O
SQL O
Injection O
Tool O
and O
SQLi O
Dumper O
version O
7.0 O
(Figure O
4) O
to O
scan O
for O
and O
exploit O
vulnerabilities O
in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

At O
least O
eight O
sellers B-HackOrg
update O
the O
website O
as O
frequently O
as O
daily O
, O
offering O
newly O
obtained O
databases O
from O
the O
U.S O
. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card B-Tool
credentials I-Tool
, O
these O
actors B-HackOrg
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate O
new O
card O
numbers O
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

One O
bulk B-Tool
card-checking I-Tool
tool O
this O
group B-HackOrg
uses O
is O
Testador O
Amazon.com O
v1.1 O
(
Figure O
8 O
) O
. O

Despite O
its O
name O
, O
this O
tool O
does O
not O
use O
Amazon’s O
website O
, O
but O
exploits O
an O
unauthenticated O
Cross-Site O
Request O
Forgery O
(CSRF) O
vulnerability O
of O
a O
merchant O
website O
allowing O
the O
abuse O
of O
PayPal B-Tool
Payflow I-Tool
link O
functionality O
(Figure O
9) O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
of O
interactions O
in O
this O
channel O
, O
between O
May O
2016 O
and O
June O
2016 O
, O
malicious O
actors B-HackOrg
validated O
2 O
, O
987 O
cards O
from O
62 O
countries O
, O
with O
the O
most O
coming O
from O
the O
U.S. O
(nearly O
half) O
, O
Brazil O
, O
and O
France O
. O

The O
actors B-HackOrg
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create O
cloned O
physical O
cards O
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw O
funds O
from O
ATMs O
. O

The O
group B-HackOrg
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-Tool
606 I-Tool
Software I-Tool
(Figure O
12) O
and O
Hardware B-Tool
(Figure O
13) O
to O
create O
cloned O
cards O
. O

However O
, O
Brazilian O
actors B-HackOrg
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen O
cards O
in O
return O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
bill's O
value O
and O
reselling O
illicitly O
obtained O
goods O
. O

Some O
attacker B-HackOrg
tools O
were O
used O
to O
almost O
exclusively O
target O
organizations O
within O
APAC O
. O

In O
April O
2015 O
, O
we O
uncovered O
the O
malicious O
efforts O
of O
APT30 B-HackOrg
, O
a O
suspected O
China-based O
threat O
group O
that O
has O
exploited O
the O
networks O
of O
governments O
and O
organizations O
across O
the O
region O
, O
targeting O
highly O
sensitive O
political O
, O
economic O
and O
military O
information O
. O

The O
individuals B-HackOrg
using O
Hancitor B-Tool
malware O
also O
known O
by O
the O
name O
Chanitor B-Tool
are O
no O
exception O
and O
have O
taken O
three O
approaches O
to O
deliver O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
ultimately O
steal O
data O
from O
their O
victims O
. O

We O
recently O
observed O
Hancitor B-HackOrg
attacks O
against O
some O
of O
our O
FireEye O
Exploit O
Guard O
customers O
. O

The O
group B-HackOrg
has O
performed O
these O
activities O
at O
multiple O
locations O
across O
Brazil O
, O
possibly O
using O
multiple O
mules O
. O

Once O
downloaded O
and O
executed O
, O
it O
drops O
an O
intermediate O
payload O
that O
further O
downloads O
a O
Pony O
DLL O
and O
Vawtrak O
executable O
, O
which O
perform O
data O
theft O
and O
connect O
to O
a O
command O
and O
control O
(C2) O
server O
. O

The O
attachment O
in O
these O
emails O
is O
a O
weaponized O
Microsoft O
Office O
document O
containing O
a O
malicious O
macro O
that O
– O
when O
enabled O
– O
leads O
to O
the O
download O
of O
Hancitor O
. O

After O
the O
executable O
is O
executed O
, O
O
it O
downloads O
Pony O
and O
Vawtrak O
malware O
variants O
to O
steal O
data O
. O

Upon O
execution O
, O
it O
will O
communicate O
with O
an O
attacker-controller O
website O
to O
download O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
Pony O
malware O
, O
pm.dll” O
along O
with O
a O
standard O
Vawtrak O
trojan O
. O

In O
this O
blog O
, O
FireEye O
Labs O
dissects O
this O
new O
ATM O
malware O
that O
we O
have O
dubbed O
RIPPER O
(due O
to O
the O
project O
name O
ATMRIPPER” O
identified O
in O
the O
sample) O
and O
documents O
indicators O
that O
strongly O
suggest O
this O
piece O
of O
malware O
is O
the O
one O
used O
to O
steal O
from O
the O
ATMs O
at O
banks O
in O
Thailand O
. O

RIPPER O
interacts O
with O
the O
ATM O
by O
inserting O
a O
specially O
manufactured O
ATM O
card O
with O
an O
EMV O
chip O
that O
serves O
as O
the O
authentication O
mechanism O
. O

RIPPER O
will O
examine O
the O
contents O
of O
directories O
associated O
with O
the O
targeted O
ATM O
vendors O
and O
will O
replace O
legitimate O
executables O
with O
itself O
. O

Once O
a O
valid O
card O
with O
a O
malicious O
EMV O
chip O
is O
detected O
, O
RIPPER O
will O
instantiate O
a O
timer O
to O
allow O
a O
thief O
to O
control O
the O
machine O
. O

This O
malware O
family O
can O
be O
used O
to O
compromise O
multiple O
vendor O
platforms O
and O
leverages O
uncommon O
technology O
to O
access O

Discovered O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
Mexico O
back O
in O
2013 O
, O
Ploutus O
enabled O
criminals O
to O
empty O
ATMs O
using O
either O
an O
external O
keyboard O
attached O
to O
the O
machine O
or O
via O
SMS O
message O
, O
a O
technique O
that O
had O
never O
been O
seen O
before O
. O

FireEye O
Labs O
recently O
identified O
a O
previously O
unobserved O
version O
of O
Ploutus O
, O
dubbed O
Ploutus-D O
, O
that O
interacts O
with O
KAL’s O
Kalignite O
multivendor O
ATM O
platform O
. O

The O
samples O
we O
identified O
target O
the O
ATM O
vendor O
Diebold O
. O

This O
blog O
covers O
the O
changes O
, O
improvements O
, O
and O
Indicators O
of O
Compromise O
(IOC) O
of O
Ploutus-D O
in O
order O
to O
help O
financial O
organizations O
identify O
and O
defend O
against O
this O
threat O
. O

Ploutus-D O
also O
allows O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
to O
enter O
the O
amount O
to O
withdraw O
(billUnits O
– O
4 O
digits) O
and O
the O
number O
of O
cycles O
(billCount O
– O
2 O
digits) O
to O
repeat O
the O
dispensing O
operation O
(see O
Figure O
10) O
. O

Ploutus-D O
will O
load O
KXCashDispenserLib” O
library O
implemented O
by O
Kalignite O
Platform O
(K3A.Platform.dll) O
to O
interact O
with O
the O
XFS O
Manager O
and O
control O
the O
Dispenser O
(see O
Figure O
13) O
. O

Since O
Ploutus-D O
interacts O
with O
the O
Kalignite O
Platform O
, O
only O
minor O
modifications O
to O
the O
Ploutus-D O
code O
may O
be O
required O
to O
target O
different O
ATM O

Finally O
, O
Mandiant’s O

of O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
, O
a O
financially O

group O
that O

These O
attackers B-HackOrg
can O
potentially O
grab O
sensitive O
online O

other O
personal O

, O
and O
even O

Our O
visibility O
into O
APT28’s B-HackOrg
operations O
, O
which O
date O
to O
at O

2007 O
, O
has O
allowed O
us O
to O
understand O
the O
group’s O
malware O
, O
operational O
changes O
and O
motivations O
. O

This O
intelligence O
has O
been O
critical O
to O
protecting O
and O
informing O
our O
clients O
, O
exposing O
this O
threat O
and O
strengthening O
our O
confidence O
in O
attributing O
APT28 B-HackOrg
to O
the O
Russian O
government O
. O

The O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
used O
two O
publicly O
available O
techniques O
, O
an O
AppLocker O
whitelisting O

and O
a O
script O
to O
inject O
shellcode O
into O
the O

. O

The O
regsvr32.exe O
executable O
can O
be O
used O
to O
download O
a O

Component O
file O
(SCT O
file) O
by O
passing O
the O
URL O
of O
the O
SCT O
file O
as O
an O
argument O
. O

We O
observed O
implementation O
of O
this O
bypass O
in O
the O
macro O
code O
to O
invoke O
regsvr32.exe O
, O
along O
with O
a O
URL O
passed O
to O
it O
which O
was O
hosting O
a O
malicious O
SCT O
file O
. O

There O
was O
code O
to O
download O
a O

document O
from O
the O
Internet O
and O
open O
it O
in O
a O
second O
winword.exe O
process O
using O
the O
Start-Process O
cmdlet O
. O

Ordnance O
will O
be O
able O
to O

This O
suggests O
that O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
main O

have O
discovered O
that O
this O
attack O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
Whitefly B-HackOrg
, O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 O
, O
has O
targeted O
organizations O
based O
mostly O
in O
Singapore O
across O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
sectors O
, O
and O
is O
primarily O
interested O
in O
stealing O
large O
amounts O
of O
sensitive O
information O
. O

Whitefly B-HackOrg
compromises O
its O
victims O
using O
custom O
malware O
alongside O
open-source O
hacking O
tools O
and O
living O
off O
the O
land O
tactics O
, O
such O
as O
malicious O
PowerShell B-Tool
scripts I-Tool
. O

From O
mid-2017 O
to O
mid-2018 O
, O
Whitefly B-HackOrg
launched O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
multiple O
organizations O
. O

While O
most O
of O
these O
organizations O
were O
based O
in O
Singapore O
, O
some O
were O
multinational O
organizations O
with O
a O
presence O
in O
Singapore O
. O

To O
date O
, O
Whitefly B-HackOrg
has O
attacked O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare O
, O
media O
, O
telecommunications O
, O
and O
engineering O
sectors O
. O

Whitefly B-HackOrg
first O
infects O
its O
victims O
using O
a O
dropper B-Tool
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
malicious.exe O
or O
.dll O
file O
that O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O
document O
or O
image O
. O

If O
opened O
, O
the O
dropper B-Tool
runs O
a O
loader O
known O
as O
Trojan.Vcrodat B-Tool
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Whitefly B-HackOrg
has O
consistently O
used O
a O
technique O
known O
as O
search B-Tool
order I-Tool
hijacking I-Tool
to O
run O
Vcrodat B-Tool
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
Vcrodat B-Tool
loads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
on O
to O
the O
victim O
's O
computer O
. O

Whitefly B-HackOrg
rely O
heavily O
on O
tools O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Tool
to O
obtain O
credentials O
. O

Using O
these O
credentials B-Tool
, O
the O
attackers O
are O
able O
to O
compromise O
more O
machines O
on O
the O
network O
and O
, O
from O
those O
machines O
, O
again O
obtain O
more O
credentials O
. O

Whitefly B-HackOrg
usually O
attempts O
to O
remain O
within O
a O
targeted O
organization O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time—often O
months—in O
order O
to O
steal O
large O
volumes O
of O
information O
. O

In O
order O
to O
carry O
out O
this O
operation O
, O
it O
uses O
publicly B-Tool
available I-Tool
tools I-Tool
, O
including O
Mimikatz B-Tool
( O
Hacktool.Mimikatz B-Tool
) O
and O
an O
open-source O
tool O
that O
exploits O
a O
known O
Windows O
privilege O
escalation O
vulnerability O
( O
CVE-2016-0051 B-Exp
) O
on O
unpatched O
computers O
. O

Like O
Vcrodat B-Tool
, O
Nibatad B-Tool
is O
also O
a O
loader O
that O
leverages O
search O
order O
hijacking O
, O
and O
downloads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
to O
the O
infected O
computer O
. O

Why O
Whitefly B-HackOrg
uses O
these O
two O
different O
loaders B-Tool
in O
some O
of O
its O
attacks O
remains O
unknown O
. O

While O
Vcrodat B-Tool
is O
delivered O
via O
the O
malicious O
dropper B-Tool
, O
we O
have O
yet O
to O
discover O
how O
Nibatad B-Tool
is O
delivered O
to O
the O
infected O
computer O
. O

Between O
May O
2017 O

LUNAR B-HackOrg
SPIDER I-HackOrg
had O
already O
introduced O
BokBot B-Tool
to O
the O

market O
at O
the O
time O
Neverquest O
operations O
ceased O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
malware O
change O
may O
have O
been O
planned O
. O

Its O
origins O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
the O
Storm O
Worm O
, O
a O
botnet O
that O
emerged O
in O
2007 O
and O
was O
one O
of O
the O
earliest O
criminal O
malware O
infrastructures O
to O
leverage O
peer-to-peer O
technology O
. O

After O
the O
demise O
of O

, O
it O
was O
replaced O
by O
another O
new O
botnet O
known O
as O
Waledac B-Tool
that O
also O
leveraged O
peer-to-peer O
communications O
. O

Although O
BokBot B-Tool
has O
aided O
the O
