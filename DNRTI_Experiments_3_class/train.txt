Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
APT1 B-HackOrg
is O
likely O
government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China O
's O
cyber B-HackOrg
threat I-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg

FireEye O
said O
it O
has O
tracked O
admin@338 B-HackOrg

activity O
since O
2013 O

the O
group B-HackOrg
has O
largely O
targeted O
organizations O
involved O
in O
financial O
, O
economic O
, O
and O
trade O
policy O
. O

The O
simplest O
conclusion O
based O
on O
these O
facts O
is O
that O
APT1 B-HackOrg
is O
operating O
in O
China O
, O
and O
most O
likely O
in O
Shanghai O
. O

These O
data O
sets O
show O
that O
APT1 B-HackOrg
is O
either O
operating O
in O
China O
during O
normal O
Chinese O
business O
hours O
or O
that O
APT1 B-HackOrg
is O
intentionally O
going O
to O
painstaking O
lengths O
to O
look O
like O
they O
are O
. O

APT1 B-HackOrg
has O
used O
and O
steadily O
modified O
BISCUIT B-Tool
since O
as O
early O
as O
2007 O
and O
continues O
to O
use O
it O
presently O
. O

While O
APT1 B-HackOrg
intruders O
occasionally O
use O
publicly B-Tool
available I-Tool
backdoors I-Tool
such O
as O
Poison B-Tool
Ivy I-Tool
and O

Given O
the O
mission O
, O
resourcing O
, O
and O
location O
of O

, O
we O
conclude O
that O
PLA B-HackOrg
Unit I-HackOrg
61398 I-HackOrg
is O
APT1 B-HackOrg
. O

APT1 B-HackOrg
were O
a O

active O
since O

APT12 B-HackOrg

consistent O
with O
larger O

Since O
the O
release O
of O

, O
FireEye O
has O
observed O
APT12 B-HackOrg
use O
a O
modified O
backdoor O
that O
we O
call O
HIGHTIDE B-Tool
. O

However O
, O
the O
malware O
shared O
several O
traits O
with O
the O
RIPTIDE B-Tool
and O
HIGHTIDE B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
that O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT12 B-HackOrg
. O

From O
October O
2012 O
to O
May O
2014 O
, O
FireEye O
observed O
APT12 B-HackOrg
utilizing O
RIPTIDE B-Tool
, O
that O
communicates O
via O
HTTP B-Tool
to O
a O
hard-coded O
command O
and O

CVE-2012-0158 B-Exp

FireEye O
believes O
the O
change O
from O
RIPTIDE B-Tool
to O
HIGHTIDE B-Tool
represents O
a O
temporary O
tool O
shift O
to O

However O
, O
three O
themes O
in O
APT28 B-HackOrg

targeting O
clearly O
reflects O
areas O
of O
specific O
interest O
to O
an O
Eastern O
European O
government O
, O
most O
likely O
the O
Russian O
government O
. O

We O
identified O
three O
themes O
in O
APT28 B-HackOrg
's O
lures O
and O
registered O
domains O
, O
which O
together O
are O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
the O
Russian O
government O
. O

Georgian O
military O
security O
issues O
, O
particularly O
with O
regard O
to O
U.S. O
cooperation O
and O
NATO O
, O
provide O
a O
strong O
incentive O
for O
Russian O
state-sponsored O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
to O
steal O
information O
that O
sheds O
light O
on O
these O
topics O

Instead O
, O
we O
observed O
the O
two O
Russian O
espionage B-HackOrg
groups I-HackOrg
compromise O
the O
same O
systems O
and O
engage O
separately O
in O
the O
theft O
of O
identical O
credentials O
. O

APT28 B-HackOrg
's O
malware O
settings O
suggest O
that O
the O
developers O
have O
done O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
work O
in O
a O
Russian O
language O

environment O
during O

business O
hours O
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
the O
Russian O
government O
is O
APT28 B-HackOrg

sponsor O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
APT28 B-HackOrg
's O
targeting O
of O
the O
MOD O
aligns O
with O
Russian O
threat O
perceptions O
. O

We O
assess O
that O
APT28 B-HackOrg
is O
most O
likely O
sponsored O
by O
the O
Russian O
government O
. O

Given O
the O
available O
data O
, O
we O
assess O
that O
APT28 B-HackOrg

work O
is O
sponsored O
by O
the O
Russian O
government O
. O

The O
targets O
were O
similar O
to O
a O
2015 O

The O
targets O
of O

Some O
of O
APT28 B-HackOrg

to O
primarily O
threaten O
organizations O
and O
individuals O
operating O
in O
Russia O

this O

illustrates O
its O
willingness O
to O
expand O
its O
scope O
to O
other O
targets O
that O
have O
intelligence O
of O

the O

CTU O

assess O
with O
moderate O

operating O
from O

is O
gathering O
intelligence O
on O

of O

The O
Dukes B-HackOrg
are O
a O
well-resourced O
, O
highly O
dedicated O
and O
organized O
cyberespionage B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
that O
we O
believe O
has O

2008 O
to O

in O

of O
foreign O
and O
security O
policy O

. O

The O
Dukes B-HackOrg
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O
as O
MiniDuke B-Tool
, O
CosmicDuke B-Tool
, O
OnionDuke B-Tool
, O
CozyDuke B-Tool
, O
CloudDuke B-Tool
, O
SeaDuke B-Tool
, O
HammerDuke B-Tool
, O
PinchDuke B-Tool
, O
and O
GeminiDuke B-Tool
. O

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke O
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky O
Labs O
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke B-Tool
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related B-Tool
malware I-Tool
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group B-HackOrg
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-Tool
, O
and O
thus O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes B-HackOrg
" O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign O
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke B-Tool
samples I-Tool
discovered O
from O
2009 O
, O
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
during O
that O
year O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Defense O
of O
Georgia O
and O
the O
ministries O
of O
foreign O
affairs O
of O
Turkey O
and O
Uganda O
. O

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-Tool
trojan I-Tool
samples I-Tool
always O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign O
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack O
campaigns O
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
, O
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O
loader O
have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related O
toolsets O
CosmicDuke B-Tool
, O
PinchDuke B-Tool
, O
and O
MiniDuke B-Tool
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes B-HackOrg
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke B-Tool
and O
CozyDuke B-Tool
. O

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February O
2013 O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-Tool
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke O
campaigns O
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
( O
such O
as O
Operation O
Pawn O
Storm O
) O
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine O
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes B-HackOrg
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine O
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia O
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia O
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine O
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke B-Tool
during O
the O
spring O
of O
2015 O
. O

The O
Dukes B-HackOrg
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke B-Tool
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke O
campaigns O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke B-Tool
and O
HammerDuke B-Tool
. O

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke O
campaigns O
of O
February O
2013 O
and O
CosmicDuke O
campaigns O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
, O
again O
the O
group B-HackOrg
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns O
with O
CozyDuke O
and O
CloudDuke O
, O
the O
Dukes B-HackOrg
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert O
, O
surgical O
campaigns O
using O
CosmicDuke B-Tool
. O

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 B-Exp
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke B-Tool
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day B-Exp
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
group B-HackOrg
acquired O
the O
exploit O
. O

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O
our O
opinion O
suggest O
that O
the O
group B-HackOrg
operates O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
. O

This O
assertion O
of O
time O
zone O
is O
also O
supported O
by O
timestamps O
found O
in O
many O
GeminiDuke B-Tool
samples I-Tool
, O
which O
similarly O
suggest O
the O
group B-HackOrg
work O
in O
the O
Moscow O
Standard O
Time O
timezone O
, O
as O
further O
detailed O
in O
the O
section O
on O
the O
technical O
analysis O
of O
GeminiDuke B-Tool
. O

Mandiant O
has O
observed O
APT29 B-HackOrg
using O
a O

that O
we O
call O
POSHSPY B-Tool

Mandiant O
has O
since O
identified O
POSHSPY B-Tool
in O
several O
other O
environments O
compromised O
by O
APT29 B-HackOrg
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
. O

In O
the O
investigations O
Mandiant O
has O
conducted O
, O
it O
appeared O
that O
APT29 B-HackOrg
deployed O
POSHSPY B-Tool
as O
a O
secondary O
backdoor O
for O
use O
if O
they O
lost O
access O
to O
their O
primary O
backdoors O
. O

POSHSPY B-Tool
is O
an O
excellent O
example O
of O
the O
skill O
and O
craftiness O
of O
APT29 B-HackOrg

The O

APT38 B-HackOrg

carefully O
conducting O

institutions O

balancing O
financially O

objectives O
with O
learning O
about O

The O

has O
compromised O
more O
than O
16 O
organizations O
in O
at O
least O
13 O
different O
countries O
, O
sometimes O
simultaneously O
, O

APT38 B-HackOrg
shares O

code O

other O
development O
resources O
with O
TEMP.Hermit B-HackOrg
North O
Korean O
cyber O
espionage O
activity O
, O
although O
we O
consider O
APT38 B-HackOrg

We O
consider O
APT38 B-HackOrg
's O
operations O
more O
global O
and O
highly O
specialized O
for O
targeting O
the O
financial O
sector O
. O

APT38 B-HackOrg
is O
a O
financially O
motivated O
group B-HackOrg
linked O
to O
North O
Korean O
cyber B-HackOrg
espionage I-HackOrg
operators I-HackOrg
, O
renown O
for O
attempting O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial O
institutions O
and O
their O
brazen O
use O
of O
destructive O
malware O
. O

Because O
APT38 B-HackOrg
is O
backed O
by O
( O
and O
acts O
on O
behalf O
of O
) O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
categorize O
the O
group B-HackOrg
as O
an O
" O
APT B-HackOrg
" O
instead O
of O
a O
" O
FIN O
" O
. O

Over O
time O
these O
malware O
similarities O
diverged O
, O
as O
did O
targeting O
, O
intended O
outcomes O
, O
and O
TTPs O
, O
almost O
certainly O
indicating O
that O
TEMP.Hermit O
activity O
is O
made O
up O
of O
multiple O
operational B-HackOrg
groups I-HackOrg
primarily O
linked O
together O
with O
shared O
malware O
development O
resources O
and O
North O
Korean O
state O
sponsorship O
. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity O
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 B-HackOrg
's O
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial O
institutions O
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise O
large O
sums O
of O
money O
for O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
. O

Since O
2015 O
, O
APT38 B-HackOrg
has O
attempted O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial O
institutions O
. O

APT38 B-HackOrg
has O
pursued O
their O
main O
objective O
of O
targeting O
banks O
and O
financial O
entities O
since O
at O
least O
2014 O
. O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks O
, O
media O
, O
and O
government O
agencies O
is O
conducted O
in O
support O
of O
APT38 B-HackOrg
's O
primary O
mission O
. O

The O
APT38 B-HackOrg
targeted O
news O
outlets O
known O
for O
their O
business O
and O
financial O
sector O
reporting O
, O
probably O
in O
support O
of O
efforts O
to O
identify O
and O
compromise O
additional O
financial O
institutions O
. O

APT38 B-HackOrg
also O
targeted O
financial O
transaction O
exchange O
companies O
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O
to O
banks O
. O

Given O
the O
lapse O
in O
time O
between O
the O
spear-phishing O
and O
the O
heist O
activity O
in O
the O
above O
example O
, O
we O
suggest O
two O
separate O
but O
related O
groups B-HackOrg
under O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
missions O
; O
one O
associated O
with O
reconnaissance O
( O
TEMP.Hermit B-HackOrg
or O
a O
related O
group B-HackOrg
) O
and O
another O
for O
the O
heists O
( O
APT38 B-HackOrg
) O
. O

APT38 B-HackOrg
, O
in O
particular O
, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O
financial O
institutions O
and O
operations O
that O
attempt O
to O
use O
SWIFT B-Tool
fraud O
to O
steal O
millions O
of O
dollars O
at O
a O
time O
. O

We O
can O
confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 O
operator O
activity O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
, O
but O
maintains O
a O
set O
of O
common O
characteristics O
, O
including O
motivation O
, O
malware O
, O
targeting O

and O
TTPs O
that O

appear O
to O
be O
Financial O

Since O
at O

the O
beginning O
of O
2014 O
, O
APT38 B-HackOrg
operations O
have O
focused O
almost O
exclusively O
on O
developing O

While O
North O
Korean O
cyber O
operations O
against O
specific O
countries O
may O
have O
been O
driven O
by O
diplomatic O
factors O
and O
perceived O
insults O
against O
Pyongyang O
, O
the O
application O
of O
increasingly O
restrictive O
and O
numerous O
financial O
sanctions O
against O
North O
Korea O
probably O
contributed O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
APT38 B-HackOrg
. O

APT38 B-HackOrg
's O
operations O
began O
in O
February O
2014 O
and O
were O
likely O
influenced O
by O
financial O
sanctions O
enacted O
in O
March O
2013 O
that O
blocked O
bulk O
cash O
transfers O

Early O
APT38 B-HackOrg
operations O
suggest O
that O
the O
group B-HackOrg
began O
targeting O
financial O
institutions O
with O
an O
intent O
to O
manipulate O
financial O
transaction O
systems O
at O

as O
early O
as O
February O
2014 O
, O
although O
we O
did O
not O
observe O
fraudulent O

until O
2015 O
. O

We O
do O
not O
have O
evidence O
that O
the O
earliest O
targeted O
financial O
institutions O
were O
victimized O
by O
fraudulent O

before O

left O

that O

In O

the O
APT38 B-HackOrg

From O
November O
2015 O
through O
the O
end O
of O
2016 O
, O
APT38 B-HackOrg
was O
involved O
in O
at O

nine O
separate O
compromises O
against O
banks O

Per O
the O

the O

Further O
, O
the O
recent O

insight O

initial O

techniques O
conducted O
by O
North O

operators B-HackOrg

APT38 B-HackOrg

, O
which O
may O
have O
been O
leveraged O
as O
part O
of O
the O
initial O

into O
the O

organizations O
. O

This O
is O
corroborated O
by O
our O
identification O
of O
TEMP.Hermit B-HackOrg
's O
use O
of O
MACKTRUCK B-Tool
at O
a O
bank O
, O
preceding O
the O
APT38 B-HackOrg
operation O
targeting O
the O
bank O
's O
SWIFT O
systems O
in O
late O
2015 O
. O

APT38 B-HackOrg
relies O
on O
DYEPACK B-Tool
, O
a O
SWIFT O
transaction-hijacking O
framework O
, O
to O
initiate O
transactions O
, O
steal O
money O
, O
and O
hide O
any O
evidence O
of O
the O
fraudulent O
transactions O
from O
the O
victimized O
bank O

The O
APT38 B-HackOrg
uses O

to O
manipulate O
the O

malicious O
transactions O
, O
so O

review O
recent O

During O
this O

APT38 B-HackOrg
waited O
for O
a O

in O
the O

increase O
the O
likelihood O

hiding O
the O

in O
Russia O

Since O

more O

50 O

the O

to O
rely O

Gallmaker B-HackOrg
may O
well O
have O
continued O
to O
avoid O

were O
it O
not O
for O
Symantec O

In O
this O
instance O
, O
Symantec O
identified O
the O
specific O
PowerShell B-Tool

used O
by O
Gallmaker B-HackOrg
as O
being O
suspicious O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
this O
new O

. O

Without O
Symantec O

, O
Gallmaker B-HackOrg

may O
well O
have O
remained O

. O

Previously O
, O
LookingGlass O

on O
a O

named O
" O
Operation O
Armageddon O
" O
, O
targeting O
individuals O
involved O
in O
the O
Ukrainian O

that O
would O

either O
be O
included O
in O
the O

by O
the O

Just O
a O
few O
months O
later O
, O
in O
February O

, O
we O
announced O
the O
discovery O
of O
Carbanak B-Exp
, O
a O
cyber-criminal B-HackOrg

that O
used O
custom O

Today O
at O
the O
Security O
Analyst O
Summit O
( O
SAS O
2016 O
) O
, O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
is O
announcing O
the O
discovery O
of O
two O
new O
gangs O
engaged O
in O
APT-style O
bank O
robberies O
– O
Metel B-HackOrg
and O
GCMAN B-HackOrg
– O
and O
the O
reemergence O
of O
the O
Carbanak B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
with O
new O
targets O
in O
its O
sights O
. O

In O
2015 O
, O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
researchers O
conducted O
Incident O
Response O
for O
29 O
organizations O
located O
in O
Russia O
and O
infected O
by O
these O
three O
groups B-HackOrg
. O

Kaspersky O
Lab O
is O
releasing O
crucial O
Indicators O
of O
Compromise O
( O
IOCs O
) O
and O
other O
data O
to O
help O
organizations O
search O
for O
traces O
of O
these O
attack B-HackOrg
groups I-HackOrg
in O
their O
corporate O
networks O
. O

In O
all O
, O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
discovered O
Metel B-HackOrg
in O
more O
than O
30 O
financial O
institutions O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
threat O
is O
far O
more O
widespread O
and O
we O
urge O
financial O
institutions O
around O
the O
world O
to O
scan O
their O
networks O
for O
signs O
of O
the O
Metel B-Tool
malware I-Tool
. O

A O
second O
group B-HackOrg
, O
which O
we O
call O
GCMAN B-HackOrg
because O
the O
malware O
is O
based O
on O
code O
compiled O
on O
the O
GCC O
compiler O
, O
emerged O
recently O
using O
similar O
techniques O
to O
the O
Metel B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
to O
infect O
banking O
institutions O
and O
attempt O
to O
transfer O
money O
to O
e-currency O
services O
. O

Our O
investigations O
revealed O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
drove O
around O
several O
cities O
in O
Russia O
, O
stealing O
money O
from O
ATMs O
belonging O
to O
different O
banks O
. O

Once O
inside O
the O
network O
, O
the O
GCMAN B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
uses O
legitimate O
and O
penetration O
testing O
tools O
such O
as O
Putty B-Tool
, O
VNC B-Tool
, O
and O
Meterpreter B-Tool
for O
lateral O
movement O
. O

Our O
investigation O
revealed O
an O
attack O
where O
the O
GCMAN B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
then O
planted O
a O
cron O
script O
into O
bank O
's O
server O
, O
sending O
financial O
transactions O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
$200 O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
GCMAN B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
used O
an O
MS O
SQL O
injection O
in O
commercial O
software O
running O
on O
one O
of O
bank O
's O
public O
web O
services O
, O
and O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
later O
, O
they O
came O
back O
to O
cash O
out O
. O

During O
that O
time O
they O
poked O
70 O
internal O
hosts O
, O
compromised O
56 O
accounts O
, O
making O
their O
way O
from O
139 O
attack O
sources O
( O
TOR O
and O
compromised O
home O
routers O
) O
. O

However O
, O
in O
September O
last O
year O
, O
our O
friends O
at O
CSIS O
published O
a O
blog O
detailing O
a O
new O
Carbanak B-Exp
variant O
affecting O
one O
of O
its O
customers O
. O

Kaspersky O
Lab O
's O
research O
team O
responded O
to O
three O
financial O
institutions O
in O
Russia O
that O
were O
infected O
with O
the O
GCMAN B-Tool
malware I-Tool
. O

In O
one O
remarkable O
case O
, O
the O
Carbanak B-Exp
2.0 O
gang O
used O
its O
access O
to O
a O
financial O
institution O
that O
stores O
information O
about O
shareholders O
to O
change O
the O
ownership O
details O
of O
a O
large O
company O
. O

Recently O
Subaat B-HackOrg
drew O
our O
attention O
due O
to O
renewed O

As O
part O
of O
the O
investigation O
, O
Unit O

were O
able O
to O
identify O
an O
interesting O
characteristic O
about O
how O
the O
Gorgon B-HackOrg

crew O
uses O
shared B-Tool
infrastructure I-Tool
between O

One O
interesting O
note O
about O
the O
criminal O
activity O
of O
Gorgon B-HackOrg

is O
their O
usage O
of O
Bitly B-Tool
. O

Between O
April O

May O
30 O
, O

more O
than O
2,300 O

to O
that O
of O

that O
the O

the O

In O
all O
of O
these O

the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
utilized O

KillDisk B-Tool
that O
was O
executed O
on O

We O
are O
confident O
this O
KillDisk B-Tool

was O
deployed O
by O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
, O
rather O
than O
by O
another O
, O
unrelated O
attacker B-HackOrg

This O
recent O
attack O
against O
an O

suggests O
that O

are O
recompiled O
with O
every O

we O
didn't O
see O
these O

Utilizing O
KillDisk B-Tool
in O
the O
attack O
scenario O
most O
likely O
served O
one O
of O
two O
purposes O
: O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
covering O

to O
the O
much O
talked O
about O
February O
2016 O
incident O
, O
when O
an O
unknown O
attacker B-HackOrg
attempted O
to O
steal O
up O
to O
$851M O
USD O
from O
Bangladesh O
Central O
Bank O
. O

Since O
the O
Bangladesh O
incident O
there O
have O
been O
just O
a O
few O
articles O
explaining O
the O
connection O
between O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
and O
the O
Bangladesh O
bank O
heist O
. O

However O
, O
from O
this O
it O
's O
only O
clear O
that O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
might O
have O
attacked O
Polish O
banks O
. O

Symantec O
also O
confirmed O
seeing O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
wiper O
tool O
in O
Poland O
at O
one O
of O
their O
customers O
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
afterhack O
publications O
by O
the O
media O
mentioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
stumbled O
upon O
three O
different O
attackers B-HackOrg
, O
it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
was O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
SWIFT O
transactions O
, O
or O
if O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O
malware O
to O
attack O
banks O
' O
systems O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks O
on O
banks O
to O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
, O
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O
attacker B-HackOrg
, O
including O
some O
yet O
unpublished O
details O
from O
the O
attack O
in O
Europe O
in O
2017 O
. O

Lazarus O
attacks O
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group B-HackOrg
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus B-HackOrg
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage O
and O
cybersabotage O
activities O
, O
such O
as O
attacks O
on O
Sony O
Pictures O
Entertainment O
with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O
harddrives O
in O
the O
company O
wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage O
operations O
, O
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group B-HackOrg
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff B-HackOrg
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus B-HackOrg
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks O
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial O
industry O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking O
sector O
, O
finance O
, O
and O
trading O
companies O
, O
as O
well O
as O
casinos O
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

We O
believe O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
started O
this O
watering O
hole O
attack O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2016 O
after O
their O
other O
operation O
was O
interrupted O
in O
South O
East O
Asia O
. O

We O
believe O
they O
started O
this O
watering O
hole O
campaign O
at O

other O
operation O

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa B-Tool
provides O
keylogging O
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
's O
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa B-Tool
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence O
functionality O
and O
the O
keylogging B-Tool
functionality I-Tool
. O

The O
persistence O
functionality O
of O
KiloAlfa B-Tool
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
uses O
compromised B-Tool
infrastructure I-Tool
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa B-Tool
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
( O
s O
) O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa B-Tool
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
port O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-Tool
malware I-Tool
. O

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa B-Tool
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service B-Tool
DLL I-Tool
and O
standalone B-Tool
executable I-Tool
. O

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-Tool
installer I-Tool
is O
responsible O
for O
installing O
the O
service O
DLL O
variant O
. O

While O
the O
tools O
profiled O
in O
this O
report O
are O
not O
inherently O
malicious O
, O
their O
capabilities O
are O
nonetheless O
integral O
to O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
's O
cyber O
operations O
, O
both O
espionage B-HackOrg
and O
destructive O
in O
nature O
, O
making O
them O
inherently O
dangerous O
to O
potential O
victims O
. O

These O
tools O
often O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
further O
malicious O
activity O
, O
such O
as O
the O
targeting O
of O
antivirus O
capabilities O
and O
the O
disabling O
of O
firewalls O
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
very O
fundamental O
defensive O
measures O
. O

In O

published O
a O
blog O
about O
a O
cyber O
espionage O
attack O
using O
the O
Emissary B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
as O
a O
payload O
. O

The O
oldest O
sample O
we O
found O
was O
created O
in O
2009 O
, O
indicating O
this O
tool O
has O
been O
in O

for O
almost O
seven O
years O

all O
of O
the O

written O
in O
Traditional O

, O
and O
they O
use O
themes O
related O
to O
the O

Of O
note O
, O
this O
is O
three O
years O
earlier O
than O
the O
oldest O

we O
have O
found O
, O
suggesting O
this O

has O
been O
active O
longer O
than O
previously O
documented O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
TTP O
shift O
post O
publication O
with O
regards O
to O
their O
malware O
delivery O
; O
they O
started O
using O
compromised O

legitimate B-Tool

All O
of O
the O
Emissary B-Tool

collected O
are O
written O
in O
Traditional O

, O
which O
is O
used O
primarily O
in O
Taiwan O
and O
Hong O

. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
observations O
made O
during O
this O
analysis O
is O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
development O
effort O
devoted O
to O
Emissary B-Tool
significantly O
increased O
after O
we O
published O
our O
Operation O

in O
June O
2015 O
, O
resulting O
in O
many O
new O

of O

. O

Lotus B-HackOrg
Blossom I-HackOrg
targeted O
the O
government O
, O
higher O

, O
and O

Our O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
malware O
authors O
created O
Emissary B-Tool
as O
early O
as O
2009 O
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
have O
relied O
on O
this O
tool O
as O
a O
payload O
in O
cyber-espionage O
attacks O
for O
many O
years O
. O

While O
it O
lacks O
more O
advanced O
functionality O
like O
screen O
capturing O
, O
it O
is O
still O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
most O
tasks O
desired O
by O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
: O
exfiltration O
of O

, O
ability O

, O
and O

The O
timeline O
in O
Figure O

shows O
that O
the O
Emissary B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
was O
first O
created O
( O
version O
1.0 O
) O
in O
May O
2009 O
and O
quickly O
received O
an O
update O
that O
resulted O
in O
version O
1.1 O
in O
June O
2009 O
. O

Between O
August O
and O
November O
2015 O
the O
malware O
author O
creates O
several O
new O
versions O
of O
Emissary B-Tool
, O
specifically O
5.0 O
, O
5.1 O
, O
5.3 O
and O
5.4 O
in O
a O
much O
more O
rapid O
succession O
compared O
to O
development O
process O
in O
earlier O
versions O
. O

Version O
2.0 O
received O
one O
update O
in O
October O
2013 O
before O
the O
malware O
author O
released O
version O
3.0 O
in O
December O
2014 O
. O

While O
this O
may O
be O
coincidental O
, O
the O
out-of-sequence O
version O

was O
created O
ten O
days O
after O

of O

the O

that O
the O

making O

we O
believe O
that O
it O
almost O

benefits O

which O
have O
increased O
over O
the O

in O

Due O
to O
the O
scale O
of O
the O
threat B-HackOrg

operations O
throughout O

we O
similarly O
assess O

APT10 B-HackOrg
withdrew O
from O
direct O

in O
2013 O
and O
conducted O
its O
first O
known O
retooling O
operation O
, O
upgrading O
its O
capabilities O
and O
replatforming O
to O
use O
PlugX B-Tool

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
release O
of O
the O
2013 O
FireEye O
report O
. O

Our O
report O
will O
detail O
the O
most O
recent O
campaigns O
conducted O
by O
APT10 B-HackOrg
, O
including O
the O
sustained O
targeting O
of O
MSPs O
, O
which O
we O
have O
named O
Operation O
Cloud O
Hopper O
, O
and O
the O
targeting O
of O
a O
number O
of O
Japanese O
institutions O
. O

MSPs O
therefore O
represent O
a O
high-payoff O
target O
for O
espionagefocused O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
such O
as O
APT10 B-HackOrg
. O

Given O
the O
level O
of O
client O
network O
access O
MSPs O
have O
, O
once O
APT10 B-HackOrg
has O
gained O
access O
to O
a O
MSP B-Tool
, O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
relatively O
straightforward O
to O
exploit O
this O
and O
move O
laterally O
onto O
the O
networks O
of O
potentially O
thousands O
of O
other O
victims O
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
would O
provide O
access O
to O
a O
larger O
amount O
of O
intellectual O
property O
and O
sensitive O
data O
. O

APT10 B-HackOrg
has O
been O
observed O
to O
exfiltrate O
stolen O
intellectual O
property O
via O
the O
MSPs O
, O
hence O
evading O
local O
network O
defences O
. O

The O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 O
) O
infrastructure O
chosen O
by O
APT10 B-HackOrg
for O
Operation O
Cloud O
Hopper O
is O
predominantly O
referenced O
using O
dynamic-DNS B-Tool
domains I-Tool
. O

Several O
of O
these O
provide O
enterprise O
services O
or O
cloud O
hosting O
, O
supporting O
our O
assessment O
that O
APT10 B-HackOrg
are O
almost O
certainly O
targeting O
MSPs O
. O

The O
13th O
FYP O
was O
released O

March O
2016 O
and O
the O
sectors O

known O
to O
be O

by O
APT10 B-HackOrg
are O
broadly O
in O
line O
with O
the O
strategic O
aims O
documented O
in O
this O
plan O
. O

These O
aims O
outlined O
in O
the O
FYP O
will O
largely O
dictate O
the O
growth O
of O
businesses O
in O

are O
, O
therefore O
, O
likely O
to O
also O
form O
part O
of O
Chinese O
companies O
' O
business O
strategies O
. O

APT10 B-HackOrg
has O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
primarily O
been O
known O
for O
its O
targeting O
of O
government O
and O
US O
defence O
industrial O
base O
organisations O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
known O
date O
of O
its O
activity O
being O
in O
December O
2009 O
. O

Observed O
APT10 B-HackOrg
targeting O
is O
in O
line O
with O
many O
of O
the O
historic O
compromises O
we O
have O
outlined O
previously O
as O
originating O
from O
China O
. O

In O
line O
with O
commonly O
used O
APT B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
methodologies O
, O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
aligns O
its O
decoy B-Tool
documents I-Tool
to O
a O
topic O
of O
interest O
relevant O
to O
the O
recipient O
. O

This O
section O
details O
changes O
made O
to O
APT10 B-HackOrg
tools O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
post-2014 O
, O
following O
its O
shift O
from O
Poison B-Tool
Ivy I-Tool
to O
PlugX B-Tool
. O

We O
have O
observed O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
APT10 B-HackOrg
has O
infiltrated O
a O
target O
via O
an O
MSP B-Tool
, O
it O
continues O
to O
use O
the O
MSPs O
credentials O
. O

In O
order O
to O
gain O
any O
further O
credentials O
, O
APT10 B-HackOrg
will O
usually O
deploy O
credential O
theft O
tools O
such O
as O
mimikatz B-Tool
or O
PwDump B-Tool
, O
sometimes O
using O
DLL B-Tool
load I-Tool
order I-Tool
hijacking I-Tool
, O
to O
use O
against O
a O
domain O
controller O
, O
explained O
further O
in O
Annex O
B O
. O

APT10 B-HackOrg
achieves O
persistence O
on O
its O
targets O
primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled B-Tool
tasks I-Tool
or O
Windows B-Tool
services I-Tool
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
malware O
remains O
active O
regardless O
of O
system O
reboots O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
high O
value O
domain O
controllers O
and O
security O
servers O
, O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
has O
also O
been O
observed O
identifying O
and O
subsequently O
installing O
malware O
on O
low O
profile O
systems O
that O
provide O
non-critical O
support O
functions O
to O
the O
business O
, O
and O
are O
thus O
less O
likely O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
system O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
majority O
of O
instances O
APT10 B-HackOrg
used O
either O
a O
reverse B-Tool
shell I-Tool
or O
RDP B-Tool
connection O
to O
install O
its O
malware O
; O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
also O
uses O
these O

now O
ChChes B-Tool
( O

, O
is O
designed O
to O

Once O

contains O
the O
capability O
to O
profile O
the O

it O
to O
identify O

We O

For O
example O
, O
PwC O

has O
observed O
APT10 B-HackOrg
compiling O

During O
our O

, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
APT10 B-HackOrg
once O
again O
initiate O
a O
retooling O

in O
late O
2016 O
. O

We O
observed O
the O

, O
and O
the O
introduction O

APT10 B-HackOrg
is O
a O
constantly O
evolving O
, O
highly O
persistent O
China-based O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
that O
has O
an O
ambitious O

unprecedented O
collection O

against O
a O
broad O
spectrum O
of O
sectors O
, O
enabled O
by O
its O
strategic O

. O

Since O
exposure O
of O
its O
operations O
in O
2013 O
, O
APT10 B-HackOrg
has O
made O
a O
number O
of O
significant O
changes O
intended O
to O
thwart O

. O

PwC O

uncovered O
a O

This O

An O
additional O

APT10 B-HackOrg

malware O
toolbox O
shows O
a O
clear O
evolution O
from O

actors I-HackOrg
towards O
bespoke O
in-house O
malware O
that O
has O
been O
used O
in O
more O
recent O

; O
this O
is O
indicative O
of O
APT10 B-HackOrg
's O
increasing O
sophistication O
, O
which O
is O
highly O
likely O
to O
continue O
. O

The O
threat B-HackOrg

known O
working O
hours O
align O
to O
Chinese O

its O

corresponds O
to O
that O
of O
other O
known O
China-based O

actors I-HackOrg
, O
which O
supports O
our O
assessment O
that O
these O
campaigns O
are O
conducted O
by O
APT10 B-HackOrg
. O

APT10 B-HackOrg
( O

is O
a O
Chinese O
cyber B-HackOrg

report O
a O

to O
the O
Moafee B-HackOrg

Both O
Moafee B-HackOrg

DragonOK B-HackOrg
favor O
spear-phishing O

, O
often O
employing O

military O
operations O
of O

in O
the O
South O
China O

, O
Moafee B-HackOrg
likely O
chooses O
its O

By O
targeting O
high-tech O

DragonOK B-HackOrg
may O
be O
acquiring O

. O

Security O
researchers O
subsequently O
linked O
these O

to O
a O
broader O

campaign O
that O
targeted O
not O
just O
Israelis O

Palestinians O
as O

and O
as O
discovered O
later O

even O
the O

The O
second O

, O
known O

DragonOK B-HackOrg
, O
targets O

in O
Japan O
and O
Taiwan O
. O

In O
2012 O
, O
the O
Molerats O
attacks O
appeared O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
the O
XtremeRAT B-Tool
, O
a O
freely O
available O
tool O
that O
is O
popular O
with O
attackers B-HackOrg
based O
in O
the O
Middle O

. O

But O
the O
group B-HackOrg
has O
also O
used O
Poison B-Tool
Ivy I-Tool
( O
PIVY B-Tool
) O
, O
a O
RAT B-Tool
more O
commonly O
associated O
with O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
in O
China O
— O
so O
much O
so O
that O
PIVY B-Tool
has O
, O
inaccurately O
, O
become O
synonymous O
with O
all O
APT O
attacks O
linked O
to O
China O
. O

This O
blog O
post O
analyzes O
several O
recent O
Molerats O
attacks O
that O
deployed O
PIVY B-Tool
against O
targets O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
in O
the O
U.S. O
We O
also O
examine O
additional O
PIVY O
attacks O
that O
leverage O
Arabic-language O
content O
related O
to O
the O
ongoing O
crisis O
in O
Egypt O
and O
the O
wider O
Middle O

to O
lure O
targets O
into O
opening O
malicious O
files O
. O

We O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
using O
PIVY B-Tool
is O
an O
attempt O
by O
those O
behind O
the O
Molerats O
campaign O
to O
frame O
China-based O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
for O
their O
attacks O
or O
simply O
evidence O
that O
they O
have O
added O
another O
effective O
, O
publicly-available O
RAT B-Tool
to O
its O
arsenal O
. O

We O
observed O
several O

in O
June O

we O
were O
somewhat O
confused O
as O
the O

Following O
the O

the O

The O
primary O
operational O
technique O
used O
by O
Night B-HackOrg
Dragon I-HackOrg
comprised O
a O
variety O
of O
hacker O
tools O
, O
including O
privately O
developed O
and O
customized O
RAT B-Tool
tools I-Tool
that O
provided O
complete O
remote O

capabilities O
to O
the O
attacker B-HackOrg
. O

While O
Night O

attacks O
focused O
specifically O
on O
the O
energy O
sector O
, O
the O
tools O
and O
techniques O
of O
this O
kind O
can O
be O
highly O
successful O
when O
targeting O
any O
industry O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
employed O
hacking O
tools O
of O
Chinese O
origin O
and O
that O
are O
prevalent O
on O
Chinese O
underground O
hacking O
forums O
. O

We O
have O
been O
presented O
with O
a O
rare O
opportunity O
to O
see O
some O
development O
activities O
from O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
associated O
with O
the O
OilRig O
attack O
campaign O
, O
a O
campaign O
Unit O
42 O
has O
been O
following O
since O
May O
2016 O
. O

Recently O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
these O
actors B-HackOrg
making O
modifications O
to O
their O
Clayslide B-Tool
delivery I-Tool
documents I-Tool
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
evade O
antivirus O
detection O
. O

We O
collected O
two O
sets O
of O
Clayslide B-Tool
samples I-Tool
that O
appear O
to O
be O
created O
during O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
's O
development O
phase O
of O
their O
attack O
lifecycle O
. O

On O
November O
15 O
, O
2016 O
, O
an O
actor B-HackOrg
related O
to O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
began O
testing O
the O
Clayslide B-Tool
delivery I-Tool
documents I-Tool
. O

The O
actor B-HackOrg
then O
made O
subtle O
modifications O
to O
the O
file O
and O
uploaded O
the O
newly O
created O
file O
to O
the O
same O
popular O
antivirus O
testing O
website O
in O
order O
to O
determine O
how O
to O
evade O
detection O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
making O
changes O
to O
the O
Excel O
worksheets O
that O
contain O
the O
decoy O
content O
, O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
also O
made O
changes O
to O
the O
worksheet O
that O
is O
initially O
displayed O
to O
the O
user O
. O

Taking O
a O
step O
back O
, O
as O
discussed O
in O
the O
Appendix O
in O
our O
initial O
OilRig B-HackOrg
blog O
, O
Clayslide O
delivery O
documents O
initially O
open O
with O
a O
worksheet O
named O
" O
Incompatible O
" O
that O
displays O
content O
that O
instructs O
the O
user O
to O
" O
Enable O

" O
to O
see O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
document O
, O
which O
in O
fact O
runs O
the O
malicious O
macro O
and O
compromises O
the O
system O
. O

This O
realization O
suggests O
that O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
threat B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
will O
continue O
to O
use O
their O
delivery B-Tool
documents I-Tool
for O
extended O
periods O
with O
subtle O
modifications O
to O
remain O
effective O
. O

Iranian O
threat O

In O
May O
2016 O
, O
Unit O

observed O
attacks O
of O
OilRig B-HackOrg
primarily O
focused O
on O
financial O

In O
recent O

the O

actors I-HackOrg
purport O
to O
be O
legitimate O
service O

as O
a O
social O

theme O
in O
their O
spear-phishing O

. O

The O
campaign O
appears O
highly O
targeted O
and O
delivers O
a O
backdoor O
we O
have O
called O
' O
Helminth B-Tool
' O
. O

Artifacts O
identified O
within O
the O

to O
these O
attacks O
also O
suggest O
the O
targeting O
of O
the O

industry O
in O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
related O
to O
an O
earlier O
wave O
of O

carried O
out O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
2015 O
. O

In O
May O
2016 O
, O
Unit O
42 O
began O
researching O
attacks O
that O
used O
spear-phishing O
emails O
with O

, O
specifically O
malicious O
Excel O

sent O
to O
financial O

within O
Saudi O
Arabia O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
attack O
campaign O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
two O
different O
variations O
of O
the O
Helminth B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
, O
one O
written O
in O
VBScript O
and O
PowerShell O
that O
was O
delivered O
via O
a O
macro O
within O
Excel O

and O
the O
other O
a O

Windows O
executable O
. O

FireEye O
also O
reported O
on O
these O
attacks O
in O
a O
May O
22 O
blog O

. O

The O
executable O
variant O
of O
Helminth B-Tool
is O
installed O
with O
a O
dropper B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
that O
we O
are O
tracking O
as O
the O
HerHer B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
. O

The O
Helminth B-Tool
executable O
variant O
is O
very O
similar O
in O
functionality O
to O
its O
script-based O
counterpart O
, O
as O
it O
also O
communicates O
with O
its O
C2 O
server O
using O
both O
HTTP B-Tool
and O
DNS B-Tool
queries O
. O

Helminth B-Tool
executable O
samples O
send O
artifacts O
within O
network O
beacons O
to O
its O
C2 O
server O
that O
the O
Trojan O
refers O
to O
as O
a O
' O
Group O
' O
and O
' O

. O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
group B-HackOrg
values O
hardcoded O

the O
malware O
is O
associated O
with O
the O

This O

that O
the O

are O
not O
only O
focused O
on O
financial O

While O
researching O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
two O
waves O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
on O
Saudi O
Arabian O
organizations O
in O
which O
a O
group B-HackOrg
of O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
delivered O
the O
Helminth O
Trojan O
as O
a O
payload O
. O

The O
two O
variants O
of O
Helminth B-Tool
do O
require O
different O
delivery O
methods O
, O
with O
the O
script O
variant O
relying O
on O
an O
Excel O
spreadsheet O
for O
delivery O
, O
while O
the O
executable O
variant O
is O
more O
traditional O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
can O
be O
installed O
without O
a O
delivery O
document O
. O

Since O
our O
first O
published O
analysis O
of O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
in O
May O
2016 O
, O
we O
have O
continued O
to O
monitor O
this O
group B-HackOrg
for O
new O
activity O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
scope O
of O
organizations O
targeted O
by O
this O
group B-HackOrg
has O
expanded O
to O
not O
only O
include O
organizations O
within O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
but O
also O
a O
company O
in O
Qatar O
and O
government O
organizations O
in O
Turkey O
, O
Israel O
and O
the O
United O
States O
. O

The O
group B-HackOrg
behind O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
continues O
to O
leverage O
spear-phishing O
emails O
with O
malicious O
Microsoft O
Excel O
documents O
to O
compromise O
victims O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
instances O
, O
multiple O
Qatari O
organizations O
were O
the O
subject O
to O
spear O
phishing O
attacks O
carrying O
Helminth B-Tool
samples I-Tool
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

While O
the O
malware O
deployed O
is O
not O
terribly O
sophisticated O
, O
it O
uses O
techniques O
such O
as O
DNS O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 O
) O
that O
allows O
it O
to O
stay O
under O
the O
radar O
at O
many O
establishments O
. O

Less O
than O
a O
week O
after O
Microsoft O
issued O
a O
patch O
for O
CVE-2017-11882 B-Exp
on O
Nov. O
14 O
, O
2017 O
, O
FireEye O
observed O
an O
attacker B-HackOrg
using O
an O
exploit O
for O
the O
Microsoft B-Exp
Office I-Exp
vulnerability I-Exp
to O
target O
a O
government O
organization O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

We O
assess O
this O
activity O
was O
carried O
out O
by O
a O
suspected O
Iranian O
cyber B-HackOrg
espionage I-HackOrg
threat I-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
, O
whom O
we O
refer O
to O
as O
APT34 B-HackOrg
, O
using O
a O
custom B-Tool
PowerShell I-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
to O
achieve O
its O
objectives O
. O

This O
threat B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
has O
conducted O
broad O
targeting O
across O
a O
variety O
of O
industries O
, O
including O
financial O
, O
government O
, O
energy O
, O
chemical O
, O
and O
telecommunications O
, O
and O
has O
largely O
focused O
its O
operations O
within O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

We O
assess O
that O
APT34 B-HackOrg
works O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Iranian O
government O
based O
on O
infrastructure O
details O
that O
contain O
references O
to O
Iran O
, O
use O
of O
Iranian O
infrastructure O
, O
and O
targeting O
that O
aligns O
with O
nation-state O
interests O
. O

APT34 B-HackOrg
uses O
a O
mix O
of O
public B-Tool
and I-Tool
non-public I-Tool
tools I-Tool
, O
often O
conducting O
spear O
phishing O
operations O
using O
compromised B-Tool
accounts I-Tool
, O
sometimes O
coupled O
with O
social O
engineering O
tactics O
. O

We O
believe O
APT34 B-HackOrg
is O
involved O
in O
a O
long-term O
cyber O
espionage O
operation O
largely O
focused O
on O
reconnaissance O
efforts O
to O
benefit O
Iranian O
nation-state O
interests O
and O
has O
been O
operational O
since O
at O
least O
2014 O
. O

In O
May O
2016 O

group I-HackOrg
carry O
out O
an O
attack O
on O
an O
insurance O
agency O
based O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

APT34 B-HackOrg
uses O
a O
mix O
of O
public B-Tool
and I-Tool
non-public I-Tool
tools I-Tool
, O
often O
conducting O
spear O
phishing O
operations O
using O
compromised B-Tool
accounts I-Tool
from O
trusted O
third O
parties O
, O
sometimes O
coupled O
with O
social O

tactics O
. O

Just O
over O
a O
week O
later O
, O
on O
January O
16 O
, O
2018 O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
attack O
on O
a O
Middle O
Eastern O
financial O
institution O
. O

The O
January O
8 O
attack O
used O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
ThreeDollars O
delivery O
document O
, O
which O
we O
identified O
as O
part O
of O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
toolset O
based O
on O
attacks O
that O
occurred O
in O
August O
2017 O
. O

However O
, O
the O
attack O
on O
January O
16 O
did O
not O
involve O
ThreeDollars B-Tool
at O
all O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
targeted O
organization O
in O
the O
January O
16 O
attack O
had O
already O
been O
targeted O
by O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
a O
year O
ago O
on O
January O
2017 O
. O

Instead O
, O
OilRig B-HackOrg
's O
attack O
involved O
delivering O
the O
OopsIE B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
directly O
to O
the O
victim O
, O
most O
likely O
using O
a O
link O
in O
a O
spear O
phishing O
email O
. O

In O
the O
January O
16 O
, O
2018 O
attack O
, O
we O
observed O
OilRig O
attacking O
an O
organization O
it O
previously O
targeted O
in O
January O
2017 O
. O

On O
January O
8 O
, O
2018 O
, O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
threat B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
sent O
an O
email O
with O
the O
subject O
Beirut O
Insurance O
Seminar O
Invitation O
to O
an O
insurance O
agency O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

The O
email O
contained O
an O
attachment O
named O
Seminar-Invitation.doc O
, O
which O
is O
a O
malicious O
Microsoft B-Tool
Word I-Tool
document O
we O
track O
as O
ThreeDollars B-Tool
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
due O
to O
the O
January O
2017 O
attack O
, O
the O
targeted O
organization O
may O
have O
taken O
actions O
to O
counter O
known O
OilRig B-HackOrg
TTPs O
, O
in O
this O
case O
delivering O
malicious O
macro O
documents O
, O
causing O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
operators B-HackOrg
to O
adopt O
a O
different O
delivery O
tactic O
. O

We O
also O
identified O
another O
sample O
of O
ThreeDollars B-Tool
, O
created O
on O
January O
15 O
, O
2017 O
with O
the O
file O
name O
strategy O
preparation.dot O
. O

The O
samples O
of O
ThreeDollars B-Tool
we O
collected O
in O
these O
attacks O
are O
structurally O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
first O
sample O
we O
analyzed O
in O
October O
2017 O

the O
malicious O
macro O
. O

Since O
May O
2016 O
, O
we O
have O
continued O
to O
monitor O

Based O
on O
previously O
observed O
tactics O
, O
it O
is O
highly O
likely O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg

APT34 B-HackOrg
leveraged O
the O

deploy O
POWRUNER B-Tool
and O

into O
the O

shows O
that O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
involved O
in O
the O
original O

campaign O
continue O
to O
add O
new O
Trojans O
to O
their O

and O
continue O
their O
persistent O

. O

When O
we O
first O
discovered O
the O
OilRig O
attack O
campaign O
in O
May O
2016 O
, O
we O
believed O
at O
the O
time O
it O
was O
a O
unique O
attack O
campaign O
likely O
operated O
by O
a O
known O
, O
existing O
threat B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
. O

The O
email O

is O
associated O
with O
the O
Lebanese O

of O
a O
major O
global O

. O

POWRUNER B-Tool
was O
delivered O
using O
a O
malicious B-Tool
RTF I-Tool
file O
that O
exploited O
CVE-2017-0199 B-Exp
. O

In O
July O
2017 O
, O
we O
observed O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
using O
a O
tool O
they O
developed O
called O
ISMAgent B-Tool
in O
a O
new O
set O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
. O

In O
August O
2017 O
, O
we O
found O
this O
threat B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
has O
developed O
yet O
another O
Trojan O
that O
they O
call O
' O
Agent O
Injector O
' O
with O
the O
specific O
purpose O
of O
installing O
the O
ISMAgent B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
. O

On O
August O
23 O
, O
2017 O
, O
we O
observed O
OilRig B-HackOrg
targeting O
an O
organization O
within O
the O
United O
Arab O
Emirates O
government O
. O

Based O
on O
that O
research O
and O
this O
observation O
, O
we O
postulate O
that O
the O
OilRig B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
gathered O
credentials O
to O
a O
legitimate O
user O
's O
OWA O
account O
and O
logged O
into O
the O

's O
account O
to O
send O

to O
other O
individuals O
within O
the O
same O
, O

. O

The O
OilRig B-HackOrg

continues O
to O
target O
organizations O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
in O
this O
instance O
targeting O
the O
government O
of O
the O
United O
Arab O
Emirates O
. O

The O
payload O
embedded O
within O
the O
ISMInjector B-Tool
sample I-Tool
delivered O
in O
this O
attack O
is O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
ISMAgent B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
that O
we O
had O
discussed O
in O
detail O
in O
our O
blog O
discussing O
a O
targeted O
attack O
on O
a O
Saudi O
Arabian O
technology O
company O
. O

Initial O
inspection O
of O
this O
attack O
suggested O
this O
was O
again O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
using O
their O
existing O
toolset O
, O
but O
further O
examination O
revealed O
not O
only O
new O
variants O
of O
the O
delivery O
document O
we O
named O
Clayslide B-Tool
, O
but O
also O
a O
different O
payload O
embedded O
inside O
it O
. O

In O
July O
2017 O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
attack O
on O
a O

organization O
that O
was O
also O
targeted O
by O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
in O
August O
2016 O
. O

This O
technique O
was O
observed O
in O
previous O
Clayslide B-Tool

to O
access O
the O

variant O
of O
the O
Helminth O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
had O
primarily O
associated O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
with O
using O
the O
Clayslide B-Tool
documents I-Tool
to O
deliver O
as O
a O
payload O
a O
Trojan O
we O
named O
Helminth B-Tool
; O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
the O
payload O
was O
instead O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
ISMDoor B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
with O
significant O
modifications O
which O
we O
are O
now O
tracking O
as O
ISMAgent B-Tool
. O

The O
June O
2017 O
sample O
of O
Clayslide B-Tool
contained O
the O
same O
OfficeServicesStatus.vbs O
file O
found O
in O
the O
ISMAgent B-Tool
Clayslide I-Tool
document I-Tool
, O
but O
instead O
of O
having O
the O
payload O
embedded O
in O
the O
macro O
as O
segregated O
base64 O
strings O
that O
would O
be O
concatenated O
, O
this O
variant O
obtained O
its O
payload O
from O
multiple O

within O
the O

In O
December O

, O
FireEye O
publicly O
released O
our O
first O
analysis O
on O
the O
TRITON O

to O
manipulate O
industrial O

systems O
at O
a O
critical O

facility O
and O
inadvertently O
caused O
a O

In O
our O
most O
recent O
analysis O
, O
we O
attributed O
the O
intrusion O
activity O
that O
led O
to O
the O
deployment O
of O
TRITON B-Tool
to O
a O
Russian O
government-owned O

the O

must O
ensure O

allow O
them O

this O

it O
also O
told O
us O
what O
the O
attackers O
were O
using O

for O

Thrip O

being O
used O
to O
launch O
the O
Thrip O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
worrying O
discovery O
we O
made O
was O
that O
Thrip O
had O
targeted O
a O
satellite O

operator O
. O

Thrip O
seemed O
to O
be O
mainly O
interested O
in O
the O

side O
of O
the O
company O

This O
suggests O
to O
us O
that O

motives O
go O
beyond O
spying O

may O
also O
include O

all O
cases O
, O
based O
on O
the O
nature O
of O

it O

VENOMOUS B-HackOrg
BEAR I-HackOrg
is O
an O
advanced O
, O
Russia-based O
adversary O
that's O
been O
active O
since O
at O
least O
2004 O
. O

Venomous B-HackOrg
Bear I-HackOrg
has O
deployed O
malware O
to O
targets O
using O
several O
novel O
methods O
. O

For O
years O
, O
Turla B-HackOrg
has O
relied O
, O
among O
other O
impersonations O
, O
on O
fake B-Tool
Flash I-Tool
installers I-Tool
to O
compromise O
victims O
. O

Turla B-HackOrg
merely O
uses O
the O
Adobe O
brand O
to O
trick O
users O
into O
downloading O
the O
malware O
. O

By O
looking O
at O
our O
telemetry O
, O
we O
found O
evidence O
that O
Turla B-HackOrg
installers O
were O
exfiltrating O
information O
to O
get.adobe.com O
URLs O
since O
at O
least O
July O
2016 O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
be O
as O
stealthy O
as O
possible O
by O
hiding O
in O
the O
network O
traffic O
of O
the O
targeted O
organizations O
. O

Finally O
, O
some O
of O
the O
victims O
are O
also O
infected O
with O
other O
Turla-related B-HackOrg
malware B-Tool
such O
as O
ComRAT B-Tool
or O
Gazer B-Tool
. O

Kaspersky O
Lab O
documented O
this O
behavior O
in O
2014 O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
new O
tactic O
for O
Turla O
to O
rely O
on O
fake B-Tool
Flash I-Tool
installers I-Tool
to O
try O
to O
trick O
the O
user O
to O
install O
one O
of O
their O
backdoors O
. O

Turla O
operators O
could O
use O
an O
already-compromised O
machine O
in O
the O
network O
of O
the O
victim O
's O
organization O
to O
perform O
a O
local O
MitM O
attack O
. O

Our O
January O
2018 O
white O
paper O
was O
the O
first O
public O
analysis O
of O
a O
Turla O
campaign O
called O
Mosquito O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-HackOrg
has O
used O
generic B-Tool
tools I-Tool
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
using O
open-source B-Tool
password I-Tool
dumpers I-Tool
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Tool
. O

Starting O
in O
March O
2018 O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
change O
in O
the O
campaign O
: O
it O
now O
leverages O
the O
open O
source O
exploitation O
framework O
Metasploit B-Tool
before O
dropping O
the O
custom O
Mosquito O
backdoor O
. O

Even O
an O
experienced O
user O
can O
be O
fooled O
by O
downloading O
a O
malicious O
file O
that O
is O
apparently O
from O
adobe.com O
, O
since O
the O
URL O
and O
the O
IP O
address O
correspond O
to O
Adobe O
's O
legitimate O
infrastructure O
. O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Turla O
has O
used O
Metasploit B-Tool
as O
a O
first O
stage O
backdoor O
, O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
one O
of O
its O
own O
tools O
such O
as O
Skipper B-Tool
. O

Traffic O
was O
intercepted O
on O
a O
node O
between O
the O
end O
machine O
and O
the O
Adobe O
servers O
, O
allowing O
Turla O
's O
operators O
to O
replace O
the O
legitimate O
Flash O
executable O
with O
a O
trojanized O
version O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
March O
2018 O
, O
as O
part O
of O
our O
regular O
tracking O
of O
Turla B-HackOrg
's O
activities O
, O
we O
observed O
some O
changes O
in O
the O
Mosquito O
campaign O
. O

In O
this O
post O
, O
we O
have O
presented O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
Turla O
Mosquito O
campaign O
over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O

Primary O
targets O
for O
this O
adversary O
are O
in O
the O
government O
, O
aerospace O
, O
NGO O
, O
defense O
, O
cryptology O
and O
education O
sectors O
. O

Turla O
's O
campaign O
still O
relies O
on O
a O
fake O
Flash O
installer O
but O
, O
instead O
of O
directly O
dropping O
the O
two O
malicious O
DLLs O
, O
it O
executes O
a O
Metasploit B-Tool
shellcode I-Tool
and I-Tool
drops I-Tool
, O
or O
downloads O
from O
Google O
Drive O
, O
a O
legitimate O
Flash O
installer O
. O

The O
Turla O
espionage O
group O
has O
been O
targeting O
various O
institutions O
for O
many O
years O
. O

Recently O
, O
we O
found O
several O
new O
versions O
of O
Carbon B-Tool
, O
a O
second O
stage O
backdoor O
in O
the O
Turla O
group O
arsenal O
. O

The O
Turla O
group O
is O
known O
to O
be O
painstaking O
and O
work O
in O
stages O
, O
first O
doing O
reconnaissance O
on O
their O
victims' O
systems O
before O
deploying O
their O
most O
sophisticated O
tools O
such O
as O
Carbon B-Tool
. O

Kaspersky O
APT O
Intelligence O
Reporting O
subscription O
, O
customers O
received O
an O
update O
in O
mid-February O
2017 O
. O

Like O
previous O
Turla O
activity O
, O
WhiteBear B-Tool
leverages O
compromised O
websites O
and O
hijacked O
satellite O
connections O
for O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 O
) O
infrastructure O
. O

WhiteBear B-Tool
is O
a O
parallel O
project O
or O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
Skipper B-Tool
Turla I-Tool
cluster O
of O
activity O
documented O
in O
another O
private O
intelligence O
report O
" O
Skipper B-Tool
Turla I-Tool
– O
the O
White B-Tool
Atlas I-Tool
framework O
" O
from O
mid-2016 O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla O
campaigns O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear B-Tool
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February O
to O
September O
2016 O
, O
WhiteBear O
activity O
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies O
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear O
activity O
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related O
organizations O
into O
June O
2017 O
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear B-Tool
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies O
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla B-HackOrg
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O
as O
emails O
sent O
by O
the O
German O
Foreign O
Office O
staff O
) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O
of O
email O
addresses O
registered O
by O
Turla O
operators O
for O
this O
campaign O
and O
used O
to O
receive O
exfiltrated O
data O
from O
the O
victims O
. O

It O
mainly O
targets O
Microsoft O
Outlook O
, O
a O
widely O
used O
mail O
client O
, O
but O
also O
targets O
The O
Bat! O
, O
a O
mail O
client O
very O
popular O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
. O

First O
, O
Turla B-HackOrg
steals O
emails O
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O
emails O
to O
the O
attackers O
. O

We O
identified O
several O
European O
governments O
and O
defense O
companies O
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF B-Tool
documents I-Tool
and O
interpret O
it O
as O
commands O
for O
the O
backdoor O
. O

In O
early O
2018 O
, O
multiple O
media O
claimed O
that O
Turla O
operators O
used O
mail O
attachments O
to O
control O
infected O
machines O
. O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate O
and O
exfiltrate O
emails O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla O
is O
the O
only O
espionage O
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O
emails O
, O
and O
more O
specifically O
via O
PDF B-Tool
attachments I-Tool
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
infected O
in O
March O
2017 O
. O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O
compromised O
organizations O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O
Turla O
group O
who O
planted O
the O
backdoor O
, O
but O
also O
by O
other O
attackers O
. O

The O
developers O
refer O
to O
this O
tool O
by O
the O
name O
Kazuar B-Tool
, O
which O
is O
a O
Trojan O
written O
using O
the O
Microsoft.NET O
Framework O
that O
offers O
actors O
complete O
access O
to O
compromised O
systems O
targeted O
by O
its O
operator O
. O

We O
suspect O
the O
Kazuar B-Tool
tool I-Tool
may O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Turla O
threat O
actor O
group O
( O
also O
known O
as O
Uroburos B-HackOrg
and O
Snake B-HackOrg
) O
, O
who O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
have O
compromised O
embassies O
, O
defense O
contractors O
, O
educational O
institutions O
, O
and O
research O
organizations O
across O
the O
globe O
. O

This O
is O
also O
a O
full-featured B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
controlled O
by O
email O
, O
and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O
other O
Turla O
component O
. O

A O
hallmark O
of O
Turla O
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O
tools O
and O
code O
lineage O
in O
Kazuar B-Tool
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
at O
least O
2005 O
. O

If O
the O
hypothesis O
is O
correct O
and O
the O
Turla B-HackOrg
threat O
group O
is O
using O
Kazuar B-Tool
, O
we O
believe O
they O
may O
be O
using O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
Carbon B-Tool
and O
its O
derivatives O
. O

We O
used O
a O
combination O
of O
tools O
such O
as O
NoFuserEx B-Tool
, O
ConfuserEx B-Tool
Fixer I-Tool
, O
ConfuserEx B-Tool
Switch I-Tool
Killer I-Tool
, O
and O
de4d0t B-Tool
in O
order O
to O
deobfuscate O
the O
code O
for O
in O
depth O
analysis O
. O

Kazuar O
generates O
its O
mutex O
by O
using O
a O
process O
that O
begins O
with O
obtaining O
the O
MD5 O
hash O
of O
a O
string O
" O
[username]=>singleton-instance-mutex O
" O
. O

The O
subject O
is O
a O
series O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
private O
companies O
. O

e O
uncovered O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
hacking O
group O
which O
has O
Chinese O
origins O
. O

Also O
, O
by O
creating O
this O
type O
of O
API O
access O
, O
Turla O
could O
use O
one O
accessible O
server O
as O
a O
single O
point O
to O
dump O
data O
to O
and O
exfiltrate O
data O
from O
. O

According O
to O
our O
estimations O
, O
this O
group O
has O
been O
active O
for O
several O
years O
and O
specializes O
in O
cyberattacks O
against O
the O
online O
video O
game O
industry O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
threat O
actors O
may O
compile O
Windows O
and O
Unix O
based O
payloads O
using O
the O
same O
code O
to O
deploy O
Kazuar O
against O
both O
platforms O
. O

The O
group O
's O
main O
objective O
is O
to O
steal O

APT5 O
operate O
in O
these O
sectors O
. O

APT5 B-HackOrg
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O
least O
2007 O
. O

APT5 B-HackOrg
has O
targeted O
or O
breached O
organizations O
across O
multiple O
industries O
, O
but O
its O
focus O
appears O
to O
be O
on O
telecommunications O
and O
technology O
companies O
, O
especially O
information O
about O
satellite O
communications O
. O

APT5 B-HackOrg
targeted O
the O
network O
of O
an O
electronics O
firm O
that O
sells O
products O
for O
both O
industrial O
and O
military O
applications O
. O

The O
group O
subsequently O
stole O
communications O
related O
to O
the O
firm O

with O
a O
national O
military O
, O
including O
inventories O
and O

they O
provided O
. O

In O
one O
case O
in O
late O
2014 O
, O
APT5 O
breached O
the O
network O
of O
an O
international O
telecommunications O
company O
. O

The O
group O
used O
malware O
with O
keylogging O
capabilities O
to O
monitor O
the O
computer O
of O
an O
executive O
who O
manages O
the O
company O
's O

with O
other O
telecommunications O

APT5 O
also O
targeted O
the O
networks O
of O
some O
of O
Southeast O
Asia O
's O
major O
telecommunications O
providers O
with O
Leouncia B-Tool
malware I-Tool
. O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O
group O
sought O
access O
to O
these O
networks O
to O
obtain O
information O
that O
would O
enable O
it O
to O
monitor O

are O

Nearly O
a O

are O
now O
shining O
a O
bright O
light O
on O
the O

the O
mysterious O

The O
attacks O

an O

Over O
the O
summer O
they O
compromised O
several O
sites O
, O
including O
a O
well-known O
Uyghur O
website O
written O
in O
that O
native O
language O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
many O
other O
APT O
campaigns O
, O
which O
tend O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
spear O

to O
gain O
victims O
, O
" O
th3bug O
" O
is O
known O
for O

legitimate O

to O

. O

While O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
recover O
the O
initial O
vulnerability O
used O
, O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
same O
CVE-2014-0515 B-Exp
Adobe B-Exp
Flash I-Exp
exploit I-Exp
first O
reported O
by O
Cisco O
TRAC O
in O

. O

However O
, O
to O
increase O
success O
rates O
APT20 B-HackOrg
can O
use O
zero-day B-Exp
exploits I-Exp
, O
so O
even O
a O
properly O
patched O
system O
would O
be O
compromised O
. O

Our O
direct O
observation O
of O
in-the-wild O
spearphishing O
attacks O
staged O
by O
the O
Bahamut O
group O
have O
been O
solely O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
notices O
from O
platform O
providers O
. O

Bahamut O
was O
first O
noticed O
when O
it O
targeted O
a O
Middle O
Eastern O
human O
rights O
activist O
in O
the O
first O
week O
of O
January O
2017 O
. O

Later O
that O
month O
, O
the O
same O
tactics O
and O
patterns O
were O
seen O
in O
attempts O
against O
an O
Iranian O
women O
's O
activist O
– O
an O
individual O
commonly O
targeted O
by O
Iranian O
actors O
, O
such O
as O
Charming O
Kitten O
and O
the O
Sima O
campaign O
documented O
in O
our O
2016 O
Black O

. O

In O
June O
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-HackOrg
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
and O
malware O
apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
South O
Asia O
. O

Once O
inside O
a O
network O
, O
APT40 B-HackOrg
uses O
credential-harvesting B-Tool
tools I-Tool
to O
gain O
usernames O

, O
allowing O
it O
to O
expand O
its O
reach O
across O
the O

and O
move O
laterally O
through O
an O
environment O
as O
it O
moves O
to O
towards O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
stealing O

. O

Bahamut B-HackOrg
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O

not O
only O
maintaining O

running O
propaganda O
sites O
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities O
varied O
noticeably O
. O

In O
June O
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-HackOrg
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
and O
malware O
apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
South O
Asia O
. O

Several O
times O
, O
APT5 B-HackOrg
has O
targeted O
organizations O
and O
personnel O
based O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
same O
week O
of O
September O
a O
series O
of O
spearphishing O
attempts O
once O
again O
targeted O
a O
set O
of O
otherwise O
unrelated O
individuals O
, O
employing O
the O
same O
tactics O
as O
before O
. O

Our O
primary O
contribution O
in O
this O
update O
is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut O
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O
surveillance O
operations O
, O
and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O
belief O
that O
the O
group O
is O
a O
hacker-for-hire O
operation O
. O

As O
we O
wrote O
then O
, O
compared O
to O
Kingphish O
, O
Bahamut O
operates O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
generation O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
professionalism O
and O
ambition O
. O

In O
the O
Bahamut O
report O
, O
we O
discussed O
two O
domains B-Tool
found O
within O
our O
search O
that O
were O
linked O
with O
a O
custom B-Tool
Android I-Tool
malware I-Tool
agent I-Tool
. O

After O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
original O
report O
, O
these O
sites O
were O
taken O
offline O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
agent O
was O
even O
updated O
a O
six O
days O
prior O
to O
our O
post O
( O
the O
" O
Khuai B-Tool
" O
application O
) O
. O

FIF O
is O
notable O
for O
its O
links O
to O
the O
Lashkar-e-Taiba O
( O
LeT O
) O
terrorist O
organization O
, O
which O
has O
committed O
mass-casualty O
attacks O
in O
India O
in O
support O
of O
establishing O
Pakistani O
control O
over O
the O
disputed O
Jammu O
and O
Kashmir O
border O
region O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
is O
already O
flagged O
as O
Bahamut O
by O
antivirus O
engines O
. O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut O
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform O
providers O
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut O
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate B-Tool
software I-Tool
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing O
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more O
passwords O
. O

Bahamut O
spearphishing O
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O
SMS O
messages O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O
Google O
about O
security O
issues O
on O
their O
account O
, O
including O
a O
class O
0 O
message O
or O
" O
flash O
text O
" O
. O

These O
text O
messages O
did O
not O
include O
links O
but O
are O
intended O
to O
build O
credibility O
around O
the O
fake O
service O
notifications O
later O
sent O
to O
the O
target O
's O
email O
address O
. O

We O
have O
not O
found O
evidence O
of O
Bahamut B-HackOrg
engaging O
in O
crime O
or O
operating O
outside O
its O
limited O
geographic O
domains O
, O
although O
this O
narrow O
perspective O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O
of O
operations O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-HackOrg
's O
campaigns O
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O
or O
information O
operations O
– O
not O
destructive O
attacks O
or O
fraud O
. O

The O
targets O
and O
themes O
of O
Bahamut O
's O
campaigns O
have O
consistently O
fallen O
within O
two O
regions O
– O
South O

Pakistan O
, O
specifically O

) O
and O
the O
Middle O

XBOW B-Tool
's O
capabilities O
are O
derived O
from O
BIFROSE B-Tool
and O
KIVARS B-Tool
; O
Shrouded O
Crossbow O
gets O
its O

from O
its O
unique O

While O
PLEAD B-Tool
and O
KIVARS B-Tool
are O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
used O
in O
first O
phase O
attacks O
, O
Waterbear O
can O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
secondary O
backdoor O
installed O
after O
attackers O
have O
gained O
a O
certain O
level O
of O
privilege O
. O

Recently O
, O
the O
JPCERT O
published O
a O
thorough O
analysis O
of O
the O
Plead B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
Trend O
Micro O
, O
is O
used O
by O
the O
cyberespionage O
group O
BlackTech O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Changing O
Information O
Technology O
Inc. O
certificate O
was O
revoked O
on O
July O
4 O
, O
2017 O
, O
the O
BlackTech O
group O
is O
still O
using O
it O
to O
sign O
their O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
BlackTech O
group O
is O
primarily O
focused O
on O
cyberespionage O
in O
Asia O
. O

The O
new O
activity O
described O
in O
this O
blogpost O
was O
detected O
by O
ESET O
in O
Taiwan O
, O
where O
the O
Plead B-Tool
malware I-Tool
has O
always O
been O
most O
actively O
deployed O
. O

Attackers O
are O
targeting O
Windows O
platform O
and O
aiming O
at O
government O
institutions O
as O
well O
as O
big O
companies O
in O
Colombia O
. O

Attackers O
like O
to O
use O
spear-fishing O
email O
with O
password O
protected O
RAR B-Tool
attachment O
to O
avoid O
being O
detected O
by O
the O
email O
gateway O
. O

The O
first O
sample O
being O
captured O
was O
in O
April O
2018 O
and O
since O
that O
we O
observed O
a O
lot O
more O
related O
ones O
. O

After O
performing O
investigations O
on O
the O
classified O
victims O
, O
we O
find O
the O
attacker O
targets O
big O
companies O
and O
government O
agencies O
in O
Colombia O
. O

After O
monitoring O
and O
correlating O
the O
APT O
attack O
, O
360 O
Threat O
Intelligence O
Center O
discovered O
multiple O
related O
emails O
to O
attack O
Colombian O
government O
agencies O
, O
financial O
institutions O
and O
large O
enterprises O
. O

The O
oldest O
sample O
we've O
seen O
up O
to O
now O
is O
from O
November O
2013 O
. O

One O
of O
the O
top O
targets O
is O
the O
Japan O
Pension O
Service O
, O
but O
the O
list O
of O
targeted O
industries O
includes O
government O
and O
government O
agencies O
, O
local O
governments O
, O
public O
interest O
groups O
, O
universities O
, O
banks O
, O
financial O
services O
, O
energy O
and O
so O
on O
. O

However O
, O
the O
attack O
is O
different O
in O
two O
respects O
: O
unlike O
other O
APTs O
, O
the O
main O
focus O
of O
Blue B-Tool
Termite I-Tool
is O
to O
attack O
Japanese O
organizations O
; O
and O
most O
of O
their O
C2s O
are O
located O
in O
Japan O
. O

Originally O
, O
the O
main O
infection O
vector O
of O
Blue B-Tool
Termite I-Tool
was O
spear-phishing O
emails O
. O

Kaspersky O
Lab O
has O
detected O
a O
new O
method O
of O
first O
infection O
that O
uses O
a O
drive-by-download O
with O
a O
flash B-Exp
exploit I-Exp
( O
CVE-2015-5119 B-Exp
, O
the O
one O
leaked O
from O
The O
Hacking O
Team O
incident O
) O
. O

Kaspersky O
Lab O
also O
found O
some O
watering O
hole O
attacks O
, O
including O
one O
on O
a O
website O
belonging O
to O
a O
prominent O
member O
of O
the O
Japanese O
government O
. O

In O
early O
July O
2015 O
, O
however O
, O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
found O
a O
sample O
that O
creates O
a O
decryption O
key O
with O
Salt1 O
, O
Salt2 O
, O
and O
Salt3 O
. O

From O
early O
June O
, O
when O
the O
cyber-attack O
on O
the O
Japan O
Pension O
Service O
started O
to O
be O
reported O
widely O
, O
various O
Japanese O
organizations O
would O
have O
started O
to O
deploy O
protection O
measures O
. O

It O
employs O
AES B-Tool
in O
addition O
to O
SID B-Tool
tricks O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
decrypt O
sensitive O
data O
. O

In O
order O
to O
fight O
back O
against O
this O
cyber-espionage O
, O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
will O
continue O
its O
research O
. O

Bookworm B-Tool
's O
functional O
code O
is O
radically O
different O
from O
PlugX B-Tool
and O
has O
a O
rather O
unique O
modular O
architecture O
that O
warranted O
additional O
analysis O
by O
Unit O
42 O
. O

Bookworm B-Tool
has O
little O
malicious O
functionality O
built-in O
, O
with O
its O
only O
core O
ability O
involving O
stealing O
keystrokes O
and O
clipboard O
contents O
. O

The O
Plead B-Tool
malware I-Tool
is O
a O
backdoor B-Tool
which O
, O
according O
to O
Trend O
Micro O
, O
is O
used O
by O
the O
BlackTech O
group O
in O
targeted O
attacks O
. O

So O
far O
, O
it O
appears O
threat O
actors O
have O
deployed O
the O
Bookworm B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
primarily O
in O
attacks O
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand O
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
use O
a O
commercial O
installation O
tool O
called O
Smart B-Tool
Installer I-Tool
Maker I-Tool
to O
encapsulate O
and O
execute O
a O
self-extracting B-Tool
RAR I-Tool
archive O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
a O
decoy B-Tool
slideshow I-Tool
or O
Flash B-Tool
installation I-Tool
application I-Tool
. O

The O
self-extracting B-Tool
RAR I-Tool
writes O
a O
legitimate O
executable O
, O
an O
actor-created O
DLL O
called O
Loader.dll O
and O
a O
file O
named O
readme.txt O
to O
the O
filesystem O
and O
then O
executes O
the O
legitimate O
executable O
. O

targeted O
attacks O
. O

Using O
XREFs B-Tool
during O
static O
analysis O
is O
a O
common O
technique O
to O
quickly O
find O
where O
functions O
of O
interest O
are O
called O
. O

The O
developers O
designed O
Bookworm B-Tool
to O
be O
a O
modular B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
not O
limited O
to O
just O
the O
initial O
architecture O
of O
the O
Trojan O
, O
as O
Bookworm B-Tool
can O
also O
load O
additional O
modules O
provided O
by O
the O
C2 O
server O
. O

Although O
the O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-Tool
have O
included O
only O
keylogging O
functionality O
in O
Bookworm B-Tool
as O
a O
core O
ability O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
several O
of O
the O
embedded O
DLLs O
provide O
Leader O
with O
cryptographic O
and O
hashing O
functions O
, O
while O
others O
support O
Leader B-Tool
's O
ability O
to O
communicate O
with O
its O
C2 O
server O
. O

While O
we O
did O
not O
discuss O
the O
surrounding O
attacks O
using O
Bookworm B-Tool
in O
detail O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
threat O
actors O
deploying O
Bookworm B-Tool
primarily O
in O
attacks O
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand O
. O

Also O
, O
Bookworm B-Tool
uses O
a O
combination O
of O
encryption O
and O
compression O
algorithms O
to O
obfuscate O
the O
traffic O
between O
the O
system O
and O
C2 O
server O
. O

The O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-Tool
have O
gone O
to O
great O
lengths O
to O
create O
a O
modular O
framework O
that O
is O
very O
flexible O
through O
its O
ability O
to O
run O
additional O
modules O
directly O
from O
its O
C2 O
server O
. O

Unit O
42 O
recently O
published O
a O
blog O
on O
a O
newly O
identified O
Trojan O
called O
Bookworm B-Tool
, O
which O
discussed O
the O
architecture O
and O
capabilities O
of O
the O
malware O
and O
alluded O
to O
Thailand O
being O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
threat O
actors' O
campaigns O
. O

Leader B-Tool
is O
Bookworm B-Tool
's O
main O
module O
and O
controls O
all O
of O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
Trojan O
, O
but O
relies O
on O
the O
additional O
DLLs O
to O
provide O
specific O
functionality O
. O

The O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-Tool
use O
these O
modules O
in O
a O
rather O
unique O
way O
, O
as O
the O
other O
embedded O
DLLs O
provide O
API O
functions O
for O
Leader B-Tool
to O
carry O
out O
its O
tasks O
. O

Unit O
42 O
does O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
for O
all O
known O
Bookworm B-Tool
samples I-Tool
, O
but O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
attempted O
attacks O
on O
at O
least O
two O
branches O
of O
government O
in O
Thailand O
. O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks O
delivering O
Bookworm B-Tool
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
based O
on O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
associated O
decoys O
documents O
, O
as O
well O
as O
several O
of O
the O
dynamic B-Tool
DNS I-Tool
domain I-Tool
names O
used O
to O
host O
C2 O
servers O
that O
contain O
the O
words O
" O
Thai O
" O
or O
" O
Thailand O
" O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
threat O
actors O
will O
continue O
development O
Bookworm B-Tool
, O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
it O
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Threat O
actors O
have O
delivered O
Bookworm B-Tool
as O
a O
payload O
in O
attacks O
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand O
. O

Analysis O
of O
compromised O
systems O
seen O
communicating O
with O
Bookworm B-Tool
C2 I-Tool
servers I-Tool
also O
confirms O
our O
speculation O
on O
targeting O
with O
a O
majority O
of O
systems O
existing O
within O
Thailand O
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Bookworm B-Tool
, O
the O
Trojan B-Tool
sends O
a O
static O
date O
string O
to O
the O
C2 O
server O
that O
we O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
campaign O
code O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date B-Tool
code I-Tool
to O
track O
their O
attack O
campaigns O
; O
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build O
identifier O
for O
the O
Trojan O
. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date O
string O
hardcoded O
into O
each O
Bookworm B-Tool
sample I-Tool
as O
a O
build O
identifier O
. O

A O
Trojan O
sending O
a O
build O
identifier O
to O
its O
C2 O
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan O
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date O
string O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date O
codes O
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-Tool
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-Tool
samples I-Tool
use O
the O
static O
date O
string O
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O
attack O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
. O

Another O
decoy O

the O
Bookworm O
attack O
campaign O
contains O
photos O

an O

The O

Unit O
42 O
analyzed O
the O

which O
matches O
the O

We O

created O
a O

and O
delivered O
the O
newly O

The O

, O
as O
the O
observed O
TTPs O
are O
fairly O
static O
within O
each O

in O
this O

So O
far O
, O
Unit O
42 O
has O
seen O
infrastructure O
overlaps O
with O
servers O
hosting O
C2 O

for O
samples O
of O
the O
FFRAT B-Tool

, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
threat O
actors O
use O
these O

as O
the O

. O

The O
threat O
actors O
have O
continually O
used O
Flash B-Tool

. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O

are O
within O
the O
Bangkok O
metropolitan O
area O
where O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
government O
of O

exists O
. O

Buhtrap B-HackOrg
has O
been O
active O
since O
2014 O
, O
however O
their O
first O
attacks O
against O
financial O
institutions O
were O
only O
detected O
in O
August O
2015 O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian O
and O
Ukrainian O
banks O
. O

Buhtrap B-HackOrg
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network O
worm O
to O
infect O
the O
overall O
bank O
infrastructure O
that O
significantly O
increases O
the O
difficulty O
of O
removing O
all O
malicious O
functions O
from O
the O
network O
. O

Malicious O
programs O
intentionally O
scan O
for O
machines O
with O
an O
automated O
Bank-Customer O
system O
of O
the O
Central O
bank O
of O
Russia O
( O
further O
referred O

If O
the O

, O
CVE-2013-3906 B-Exp
or O
CVE-2014-1761 B-Exp
) O
, O
then O
the O
document O
contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O
macros O
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
criminals O
were O
spreading O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
using O
this O
method O
from O
May O
2015 O
to O
August O
2015 O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised B-Tool
websites I-Tool
to O
spread O
Buhtrap B-Tool
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O

they O
used O
the O

that O
in O
the O
Corkow B-Tool
case O
. O

Purportedly O

its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia O
. O

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap O
, O
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses O
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing O
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap O
add O
strategic O
web O
compromises O
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk B-Tool
downloader I-Tool
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October O
26th O
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe O
or O
AmmyySvc.exe O
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap B-HackOrg
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised B-Tool
websites I-Tool
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-Tool
banking I-Tool
trojan I-Tool
, O
Buhtrap O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian O
banks O
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal O
money O
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses O
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs B-Tool
, O
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants O
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap O
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 O
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM B-Tool
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial O
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing O
money O
from O
Russian O
financial O
establishments O
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap O
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 O
in O
the O
TwoBee O
campaign O
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 O
, O
the O
name O
Buhtrap O
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
. O

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap O
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news O
outlets O
. O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning O
off O
assets O
in O
transactions O
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O
. O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign O
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting O
departments O
in O
Russian O
businesses O
. O

" O
Buhgalter O
" O
means O
" O
accountant O
" O
in O
Russian O
. O

Seeing O
a O
campaign O
like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak/Carbanak B-Tool
documented O
by O
Fox-IT O
and O
Kaspersky O
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O
mimikatz B-Tool
application O
, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party B-Tool
remote I-Tool
access I-Tool
tool I-Tool
, O
changes O
system O
settings O
to O
allow O
concurrent O

and O
so O

The O

In O
addition O
to O
built-in O
functionalities O
, O
the O
operators O
of O

can O
upload O
additional O

which O
can O
perform O
any O
malicious O
task O
. O

Careto O

Mask O
campaign O
we O
discovered O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing O
e-mails O
with O
links O
to O
a O
malicious O
website O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
attackers O
use O
sub-domains B-Tool
on O
the O
exploit O
websites O
, O
to O
make O
them O
seem O
more O
legitimate O
. O

These O
sub-domains O
simulate O
sub-sections O
of O
the O
main O
newspapers O
in O
Spain O
plus O
some O
international O
ones O
like O
the O
Guardian O
and O
the O
Washington O

. O

The O
CVE-2012-0773 B-Exp
was O
originally O
discovered O
by O
VUPEN O
and O
has O
an O
interesting O
story O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
attackers O
attracted O
our O
attention O
by O
attempting O
to O
exploit O
Kaspersky B-Tool
Lab I-Tool
products I-Tool
. O

We O
initially O
became O
aware O
of O
Careto O
when O
we O
observed O
attempts O
to O
exploit O
a O
vulnerability O
in O
our O
products O
to O
make O
the O
malware O
" O
invisible O
" O
in O
the O
system O
. O

Most O
modules O
were O
created O
in O
2012 O
. O

The O
attackers O
began O
taking O
them O
offline O
in O
January O
2014 O
. O

Last O
week O
we O
discussed O
Numbered B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
, O
a O
group O
that O
is O
also O
based O
out O
of O
China O
and O
is O
fairly O
well O
known O
to O
the O

community O
, O
though O
by O
many O

. O

We O
revealed O
a O

, O
by O
virtue O
of O
several O

, O
we O
have O
affiliated O
with O
the O
Islamic O

of O

Kitten I-HackOrg
actors O
have O
a O
strong O
affinity O
for O
PHP O
server-side O
attacks O
to O
make O
access O
; O
this O
is O
relatively O
unique O
amongst O
targeted O
attackers O
who O
often O
favor O
targeting O
a O
specific O
individual O
at O
a O
specific O
organization O
using O
social O
engineering O
. O

Clever B-HackOrg
Kitten I-HackOrg
primarily O
targets O
global O
companies O
with O
strategic O
importance O
to O
countries O
that O
are O
contrary O
to O
Iranian O
interests O
. O

A O
Clever B-HackOrg
Kitten I-HackOrg
attack O
starts O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O
web B-Tool
vulnerability I-Tool
scanner I-Tool
to O
conduct O
reconnaissance O
. O

The O
scanner O
was O
identified O
as O
the O
Acunetix O
Web O
Vulnerability O
Scanner O
which O
is O
a O
commercial O
penetration O
testing O

that O
is O
readily O
available O
as O
a O
14-day O
trial O
. O

Once O
an O
exploitable O
page O
is O
identified O
, O
Clever O
Kitten O
will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
system O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
availability O
of O
exploits O
against O
web O
browsers O
, O
which O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
allows O
an O
attacker O
to O
bypass O

features O
such O
as O
Data O
Execution O
Prevention O
( O
DEP O
) O
or O
Address O
Space O

( O
ASLR O
) O
. O

Once O
an O

is O
identified O
, O
the O
actor O
will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O

to O

an O

the O

This O
activity O
is O
a O
longer O

for O
the O

than O
a O

this O
is O

on O
the O

to O
an O

by O

Talos O
reported O
that O
these O

to O
obtain O

Political O

by O
different O
actors O
, O
including O
IndigoZebra B-HackOrg

Sofacy B-HackOrg
( O

) O
and O
most O
recently O
by O

) O
. O

El O
Machete O
is O
one O
of O
these O
threats O
that O
was O
first O
publicly O
disclosed O
and O
named O
by O
Kaspersky O
here O
. O

We've O
found O
that O
this O
group O
has O
continued O
to O
operate O
successfully O
, O
predominantly O
in O
Latin O
America O
, O
since O
2014 O
. O

All O
attackers O
simply O
moved O
to O
new O
C2 O
infrastructure O
, O
based O
largely O
around O
dynamic O
DNS O
domains O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
making O
minimal O
changes O
to O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
evade O
signature-based O
detection O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Octopus B-Tool
, O
DustSquad O
used O
Delphi O
as O
their O
programming O
language O
of O
choice O
, O
which O
is O
unusual O
for O
such O
an O
actor O
. O

Targets O
included O
a O
wide O
array O
of O
high-profile O
entities O
, O
including O
intelligence O
services O
, O
military O
, O
utility O
providers O
( O
telecommunications O

) O
, O

, O
and O
government O
institutions O

Some O
time O
ago O
, O
a O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
customer O
in O
Latin O
America O
contacted O
us O
to O
say O
he O
had O
visited O
China O
and O
suspected O
his O
machine O
was O
infected O
with O
an O
unknown O
, O
undetected O
malware O
. O

It O
was O
a O
targeted O
attack O
we O
are O
calling O
" O
Machete O
" O
. O

At O
first O
look O
, O
it O
pretends O
to O
be O
a O
Java B-Tool
related I-Tool
application I-Tool
but O
after O
a O
quick O
analysis O
, O
it O
was O
obvious O
this O
was O
something O
more O
than O
just O
a O
simple O
Java O
file O
. O

" O
Machete O
" O
is O
a O
targeted O
attack O
campaign O
with O
Spanish O
speaking O
roots O
. O

The O
decoy B-Tool
slideshows I-Tool
all O
contain O
photos O
from O
very O
meaningful O
events O
to O
individuals O
in O
Thailand O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
actors O
continually O
look O
for O
impactful O
events O
to O
use O
to O
disguise O
their O
attacks O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
such O
as O
Russia O
, O
the O
target O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
embassy O
from O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
of O
this O
list O
. O

Both O
attackers O
and O
victims O
speak O
Spanish O
natively O
, O
as O
we O
see O
it O
consistently O
in O
the O
source O
code O
of O
the O
client O
side O
and O
in O
the O
Python O

. O

We O

Between O
June O
2008 O
and O
March O
2009 O
the O

an O

that O
allowed O

to O
examine O

, O
as O
well O
as O
capture O
real-time O
evidence O
of O
malware O
that O
had O
penetrated O
Tibetan O
computer O

. O

It O
is O
therefore O
possible O
that O
the O
large O
percentage O
of O
high O
value O
targets O
identified O
in O
our O

of O

In O

observed O
a O
massive O
GozNym O

operators O
were O
seen O
launching O
redirection O
attacks O
on O
four O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O

have O
already O
adapted O
the O

three O
different O
languages O

Similar O
to O
our O
approach O
with O

another O
generation O
of O

used O
by O
the O
attackers O
. O

Since O
January O
2013 O
, O
we've O
been O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
a O
possible O
RedOctober B-HackOrg
comeback O
. O

One O
possible O
hit O
was O
triggered O
when O
we O
observed O
Mevade O
, O
an O
unusual O
piece O
of O
malware O
that O
appeared O
late O
in O
2013 O
. O

In O
August O
2014 O
, O
some O
of O
our O
users O
observed O
targeted O
attacks O
with O
a O
variation O
of O
CVE-2012-0158 B-Exp
and O
an O
unusual O
set O
of O
malware O
. O

It O
wasn't O
until O
August O
2014 O
that O
we O
observed O
something O
which O
made O
us O
wonder O
if O
RedOctober O
is O
back O
for O
good O
. O

The O
Cloud O
Atlas O
implants O
utilize O
a O
rather O
unusual O
C&C O
mechanism O
. O

We O
named O
it O
RedOctober O
because O
we O
started O
this O
investigation O
in O
October O
2012 O
, O
an O
unusually O
hot O
month O
. O

The O
attackers O
upload O
data O
to O
the O
account O
, O
which O
is O
downloaded O
by O
the O
implant O
, O
decrypted O
and O
interpreted O
. O

Just O
like O
with O
RedOctober B-HackOrg
, O
the O
top O
target O
of O
Cloud O
Atlas O
is O
Russia O
, O
followed O
closely O
by O
Kazakhstan O
, O
according O
to O
data O
from O
the O
Kaspersky O
Security O
Network O
( O
KSN O
) O
. O

In O
May O
2015 O
, O
Palo O
Alto O

WildFire O
detected O
two O
e-mails O
carrying O
malicious O
documents O
from O
a O
genuine O
and O
compromised O
Israeli O
Gmail O
account O
, O
sent O
to O
an O
Israeli O
industrial O

One O
e-mail O
carried O
a O
Microsoft O
PowerPoint O

named O
" O

" O
( O
VirusTotal O
) O
, O
the O
other O
a O
Microsoft O

" O
. O

Around O
the O
same O
time O
, O
WildFire O
also O
captured O
an O
e-mail O
containing O
a O

document O
( O
" O

" O
) O
with O
an O
identical O
hash O
as O
the O
earlier O

this O
time O
sent O

Attacks O
using O
this O

were O
still O
active O
as O
of O
April O
2016 O
. O

Considering O
the O
language O
being O
used O
in O
the O
malicious O
code O
is O
Arabic O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
attacker O
is O
familiar O
with O
Arabic O
language O
as O
well O
. O

The O

, O
in O
which O
we O
described O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
decade-long O
campaign O
using O
a O
formerly O
unknown O
malware O
family O
, O
Infy B-Tool
, O
that O
targeted O
government O
and O

worldwide O
. O

We O
noted O
in O
our O
original O
blog O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
targeting O
of O
Iranian O
citizens O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
we O
observed O
almost O
one-third O
of O
all O
victims O
to O
be O
Iranian O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
original O
" O

, O
we O
also O
see O
the O
newer O
, O
more O

and O
fuller-featured O
" O

This O
documentation O
provides O
new O
insight O
into O
intrusion O
efforts O
conducted O
by O
at O
least O
four O
discrete O
Iranian O
threat O
actors O
, O
Rocket B-HackOrg
Kitten I-HackOrg
, O
Infy B-HackOrg
, O
Sima B-HackOrg
, O
and O
Operation O
Cleaver O
, O
including O
groups O
and O
tools O
that O
have O
not O
been O
previously O
disclosed O
. O

Since O
early O
2013 O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
activity O
from O
a O
unique O
threat O
actor O
group O
, O
which O
we O
began O
to O
investigate O
based O
on O
increased O
activities O
against O
human O
right O
activists O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2015 O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
three O
years O
of O
observation O
of O
campaigns O
targeting O
civil O
society O
and O
human O
rights O
organizations O
, O
from O
records O
of O
well O
over O
two O
hundred O
spearphishing O
and O
other O
intrusion O
attempts O
against O
individuals O
inside O
of O
Iran O
and O
in O
the O
diaspora O
, O
a O
narrative O
of O
persistent O
intrusion O
efforts O
emerges O
. O

Thanks O
to O
information O
we O
have O
been O
able O
to O
collect O
during O
the O
course O
of O
our O
research O
, O
such O
as O
characteristics O
of O
the O
group O
's O
malware O
and O
development O
cycle O
, O
our O
research O
strongly O
supports O
the O
claim O
that O
the O
Infy B-HackOrg
group O
is O
of O
Iranian O
origin O
and O
potentially O
connected O
to O
the O
Iranian O
state O
. O

Amongst O
a O
backdrop O
of O
other O
incidents O
, O
Infy O
became O
one O
of O
the O
most O
frequently O
observed O
agents O
for O
attempted O
malware O
attacks O
against O
Iranian O
civil O
society O
beginning O
in O
late O
2014 O
, O
growing O
in O
use O
up O
to O
the O
February O
2016 O
parliamentary O
election O
in O
Iran O
. O

Until O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
Palo O
Alto O
report O
, O
the O
developers O
of O
the O
Infy B-Tool
appeared O
to O
be O
actively O
updating O
and O
maintaining O
the O
codebase O
, O
and O
new O
releases O
were O
distributed O
to O
existing O
, O
as O
well O
as O
new O
, O
targets O
quite O
regularly O
. O

Other O
samples O
were O
found O
bearing O
a O
compilation O
time O
as O
early O
as O
June O
2012 O
and O
version O
00002 O
. O

Over O
the O
months O
following O
the O
elections O
, O
the O
accounts O
of O
Iranians O
that O
had O
been O
compromised O
by O
the O
actors O
were O
then O
used O
for O
spreading O
the O
malware O
. O

When O
activities O
targeting O
of O
civil O
society O
subsided O
, O
the O
actors O
instead O
appeared O
to O
have O
focused O
on O
external O
targets O
, O
such O
a O
series O
of O
attempts O
to O
spearphish O
the O
Danish O
Ministry O
of O
Foreign O
Affairs O
. O

Palo O
Alto O
Networks O
has O
noted O
and O
described O
the O
differences O
of O
two O
malware O
agents O
developed O
in O
parallel O
, O
with O
commonalities O
in O
behavior O
but O
differing O
functionalities O
; O
families O
described O
as O
Infy B-Tool

Infy B-Tool
M. I-Tool
Our O
primary O
observation O
was O
of O
the O
Infy B-Tool
( O
non-M O
) O
malware B-Tool
, O
which O
primarily O
functions O
as O
a O
keylogger B-Tool
for O
the O
collection O
of O

. O

Our O
observation O
of O
Infy O

campaigns O
, O
primarily O
through O
the O
lens O
of O
spearphishing O
attacks O
against O
Iranian O
civil O

, O
indicates O
a O
wandering O

on O
particular O
demographics O
on O
a O
strategic O
basis O
over O
time O
. O

The O
Infy B-Tool
malware I-Tool
was O
seen O
targeting O
Iranians O
again O
in O
June O
2015 O
, O
when O
it O
was O
shared O
with O
researchers O
after O
being O
sent O
to O
a O
broadcast O
journalist O
at O
BBC O
Persian O
with O
a O
generic O
introduction O
and O
a O
PowerPoint B-Tool
presentation O
attached O
titled O
" O
Nostalogy O
" O
( O

) O
. O

Based O
on O
information O
collected O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
research O
, O
the O
targets O
and O
victims O
of O
Infy O
's O
campaigns O
have O
continued O
to O
be O
strongly O
aligned O
with O
Iran O

, O
and O
regional O
adversaries O
of O

. O

Until O
late O
December O
2015 O
, O
in O
nearly O
every O
Infy B-Tool
message I-Tool
documented O
since O
our O
tracking O
began O
in O
May O
2013 O
, O
no O

, O
often O
not O
even O

relying O
on O
cryptic O

to O
attract O
interest O
. O

One O
narrowly-targeted O
spearphishing O
from O
Infy O
was O
sent O
from O
the O
compromised O
account O
of O
a O
political O
activist O
promoting O
participation O
inside O

, O
claiming O

As O
in O
the O
past O
, O
these O

have O
been O
sent O
accounts O
believed O
to O
be O
fake O
and O
accounts O
compromised O
by O
Infy O

that O
had O
previously O
been O
compromised O
by O
the O
Flying B-HackOrg

successfully O
compromised O
a O

on O
January O
17 O

Infy B-Tool
engaged O
in O
malware O
spearphishing O
against O
the O
same O
targets O
as O
Flying O
Kitten O
from O
the O
outset O
of O
its O
campaign O
; O
Operation O
Cleaver O
has O
registered O
several O
resources O
related O
to O
development O
agencies O
that O
have O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
intrusion O
attempts O
by O
others O
since O
February O
2014 O
. O

The O
malicious O
samples O
we O
found O
are O
the O
early O
stage O
malware O
most O
often O
delivered O
by O
spear-phishing O
e-mails O
. O

This O
next O
stage O
library O
copies O
itself O
into O
the O
System32 O
directory O
of O
the O
Windows O
folder O
after O
the O
hardcoded O
file O
name O
— O
either O
KBDLV2.DLL O
or O
AUTO.DLL O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
malware O
sample O
. O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
the O
malware O
gathers O
information O
about O
the O
infected O
computer O
. O

Hancom O
Office O
is O
widely O
used O
in O
South O
Korea O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
also O
points O
to O
the O
suspected O
North O
Korean O
origin O
of O
attack O
. O

The O
attacker O
is O
from O
North O
Korea O
. O

All O
of O
them O
lie O
in O
ranges O
of O
the O
Jilin O
Province O
Network O
and O
Liaoning O
Province O
Network O
, O
in O
China O
. O

Finally O
, O
this O
geo-location O
supports O
the O
likely O
theory O
that O
the O
attackers O
behind O
Kimsuky B-HackOrg
are O
based O
in O
North O
Korea O
. O

In O
this O
blog O
, O
we O
look O
at O
the O
Winnti B-Tool
malware I-Tool
implant O
as O
used O
by O
two O
known O
activity O
groups O
BARIUM B-HackOrg
and O
LEAD O
. O

According O
to O
the O
German O
press O
, O
the O
intruders O
used O
the O
Winnti B-Tool
family I-Tool
of I-Tool
malware I-Tool
as O
their O
main O
implant O
, O
giving O
them O
persistent O
access O
to O
the O
conglomerate O
's O
network O
as O
early O
as O
February O
2016 O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
this O
malware O
, O
the O
activity O
groups O
strongly O
associated O
with O
Winnti B-Tool
are O
BARIUM B-Tool
and O
LEAD B-Tool
. O

But O
even O
though O
they O
share O
the O
use O
of O
Winnti B-Tool
, O
the O
BARIUM B-Tool
and O
LEAD B-Tool
activity O
groups O
are O
involved O
in O
very O
different O
intrusion O
scenarios O
. O

To O
show O
how O
this O
breach O
and O
similar O
breaches O
can O
be O
mitigated O
, O
we O
look O
at O
how O
Windows O
Defender O
ATP O
flags O
activities O
associated O
with O
BARIUM O
, O
LEAD O
, O
and O
other O
known O
activity O
groups O
and O
how O
it O
provides O
extensive O
threat O
intelligence O
about O
these O
groups O
. O

BARIUM O
begins O
its O
attacks O
by O
cultivating O
relationships O
with O
potential O
victims—particularly O
those O
working O
in O
Business O
Development O
or O
Human O
Resources—on O
various O
social O
media O
platforms O
. O

During O
these O
intrusions O
, O
LEAD O
's O
objective O
was O
to O
steal O
sensitive O
data O
, O
including O
research O
materials O
, O
process O
documents O
, O
and O
project O
plans O
. O

Initial O

of O
social O
network O

, O
collaborative O
document O
editing O
sites O
, O
and O
blogs O
for O
C&C O
. O

Once O
BARIUM O
has O
established O
rapport O
, O
they O
spear-phish O
the O
victim O
using O
a O
variety O
of O
unsophisticated B-Tool

Instead O

the O

. O

Microsoft O

shows O
that O

has O
been O
used O
in O

carried O
out O
throughout O
Asia O
, O
Europe O
, O
Oceania O
, O

East O
, O
and O
the O

in O
the O

to O

to O
run O
the O

. O

In O
some O
other O
cases O
, O
LEAD O
gains O
access O
to O
a O
target O
by O
brute-forcing O
remote O

, O
performing O
SQL O

, O
and O
then O
they O
copy O
the O
Winnti B-Tool

directly O
to O
compromised O
machines O
. O

This O
was O
the O
case O
in O
two O
known O
intrusions O
in O
2015 O
, O
where O
attackers O
named O
the O

DLL O
" O
ASPNET_FILTER.DLL O

to O
disguise O
it O
as O
the O

helps O

professionals O
deal O
with O

from O
activity O
groups O
like O
LEAD B-Tool
and O
BARIUM B-Tool
in O
several O
ways O
. O

The O
following O
examples O
were O
developed O
using O
a O
Winnti B-Tool
installer I-Tool
that O
was O
used O
in O
attacks O
in O
December O
2016 O
. O

The O
Windows B-Tool
10 I-Tool
Creators I-Tool
Update I-Tool
will O
bring O
several O
enhancements O
to O
Windows O

ATP O
that O
will O
provide O
SOC O
personnel O
with O
options O
for O
immediate O
mitigation O
of O
a O
detected O
threat O
. O

LEAD O
and O
BARIUM O
are O
not O
known O
for O
large-scale O
spear-phishing O
, O
so O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
SOC O
personnel O
would O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
multiple O
machines O
having O
been O
compromised O
by O
these O
groups O
at O
the O

time O
. O

And O
, O
finally O
, O
with O
the O
upcoming O
Creators B-Tool
Update I-Tool
, O
Windows O
Defender O
ATP O
will O
provide O
additional O
capabilities O
for O
detecting O

The O
police O
suspected O
Lurk B-Tool
of O
stealing O
nearly O
three O
billion O
rubles O
, O
using O
malicious O
software O
to O
systematically O
withdraw O
large O
sums O
of O

from O
the O
accounts O
of O
commercial O
organizations O
, O
including O

. O

When O
we O
first O
encountered O
Lurk B-Tool
, O
in O
2011 O
, O
it O
was O
a O
nameless O
Trojan O
. O

While O
the O

This O
article O
is O
an O
attempt O
to O
share O
this O
experience O
with O
other O
experts O
, O
particularly O
the O
IT O
security O
specialists O
in O
companies O
and O
financial O
institutions O
that O
increasingly O
find O
themselves O
the O
targets O
of O
cyber-attacks O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
attackers O
only O
had O
to O
infect O
the O
computer O
on O
which O
the O
RBS O
software O
was O
installed O
in O
order O
to O
start O
stealing O
the O
cash O
. O

We O
were O
soon O
able O
to O
help O
investigate O
another O
incident O
involving O
Lurk B-Tool
. O

This O
event O
significantly O
affected O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
world O
as O
the O
gang O
had O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
rubles O
during O
a O
few O
years O
of O
activity O
, O
and O
was O
considered O
a O
" O
leader O
" O
among O
cybercriminals O
. O

In O
Russia O
, O
there O
were O
several O
relatively O
large O
cybercriminal O
groups O
engaged O
in O
financial O
theft O
via O
attacks O
on O
RBS O
. O

In O
April O
2013 O
, O
a O
year O
after O
we O
found O
the O
" O
bodiless O
" O
Lurk B-Tool
module I-Tool
, O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
underground O
exploited O
several O
families O
of O
malicious O
software O
that O
specialized O
in O
attacks O
on O
banking O
software O
. O

Through O
the O
information O
exchanges O
used O
by O
people O
in O
the O
security O
industry O
, O
we O
learned O
that O
several O
Russian O
banks O
were O
struggling O
with O
malicious O
programs O
created O
specifically O
to O
attack O
a O
particular O
type O
of O
legal O
banking O
software O
. O

If O
it O
did O
, O
the O
malware O
downloaded O
additional O
modules O
, O
including O
ones O
allowing O
for O
the O
automatic O
creation O
of O
unauthorized O
payment O
orders O
, O
changing O
details O
in O
legal O
payment O
orders O
, O
etc O
. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
judge O
from O
the O
data O
we O
have O
, O
in O
2014 O
the O
criminal O
group O
behind O
Lurk B-Tool
seriously O
reduced O
its O
activity O
and O
" O
lived O
from O
hand O
to O
mouth O
" O
, O
attacking O
anyone O
they O
could O
, O
including O
ordinary O
users O

2015 O
, O
Kaspersky O

Since O

, O
the O

which O
they O
launched O

against O
Russian O

2008 O
, O
The O

used O
multiple O

against O
high-profile O

. O

Longhorn O
, O
which O
we O
internally O
refer O
to O
as O
" O
The B-HackOrg
Lamberts I-HackOrg
" O
, O
first O
came O
to O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
ITSec O
community O
in O
2014 O
, O
when O
our O
colleagues O
from O
FireEye O
discovered O
an O
attack O
using O
a O
zero B-Exp
day I-Exp
vulnerability I-Exp
( O
CVE-2014-4148 B-Exp
) O
. O

The O
attack O
leveraged O
malware O
we O
called O
' O
BlackLambert B-Tool
' O
, O
which O
was O
used O
to O
target O
a O
high O
profile O
organization O
in O
Europe O
. O

Their O
arsenal O
includes O
network-driven B-Tool
backdoors I-Tool
, O
several O
generations O
of O
modular B-Tool
backdoors I-Tool
, O
harvesting B-Tool
tools I-Tool
, O
and O
wipers B-Tool
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
Lambert B-Tool
family I-Tool
malware I-Tool
was O
uncovered O
publicly O
was O
in O
October O
2014 O
, O
when O
FireEye O
posted O
a O
blog O
about O
a O
zero B-Exp
day I-Exp
exploit I-Exp
( O
CVE-2014-4148 B-Exp
) O
used O
in O
the O
wild O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
while O
most O
Blue B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
variants O
have O
version O
numbers O
in O
the O
range O
of O
2.x O
, O
Green B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
is O
mostly O
in O
3.x O
versions O
. O

While O
investigating O
one O
of O
these O
infections O
involving O
White B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
( O
network-driven O
implant O
) O
and O
Blue B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
( O
active O
implant O
) O
, O
we O
found O
yet O
another O
family O
of O
tools O
that O
appear O
to O
be O
related O
. O

Versions O
of O
this O
particular O
orchestrator O
were O
found O
on O
other O
victims O
, O
together O
with O
White B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
samples I-Tool
, O
indicating O
a O
close O
relationship O
between O
the O
White B-Tool
and O
Pink B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
malware I-Tool
families I-Tool
. O

While O
in O
most O
cases O
the O
infection O
vector O
remains O
unknown O
, O
the O
high O
profile O
attack O
from O
2014 O
used O
a O
very O
complex O
Windows O
TTF O
zero-day B-Exp
exploit I-Exp
( O
CVE-2014-4148 B-Exp
) O
. O

This O
migration O
activity O
was O
last O
observed O
in O
October O
2016 O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
Blue B-Tool
and I-Tool
Green I-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
samples I-Tool
have O
two O
C&C O
servers O
hardcoded O
in O
their O
configuration O
block O
: O
a O
hostname O
and O
an O
IP O
address O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
known O
filenames O
for O
Gray B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
are O
mwapi32.dll B-Tool
and O
poolstr.dll B-Tool
– O
it O
should O
be O
pointed O
though O
that O
the O
filenames O
used O
by O
the O
Lamberts B-Tool
are O
generally O
unique O
and O
have O
never O
been O
used O
twice O
. O

Black B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
was O
seen O
only O
briefly O
and O
we O
assume O
it O
was O
" O
retired O
" O
from O
the O
arsenal O
after O
being O
discovered O
by O
FireEye O
in O
2014 O
. O

The O
Lamberts B-Tool
toolkit I-Tool
spans O
across O
several O
years O
, O
with O
most O
activity O
occurring O
in O
2013 O
and O
2014 O
. O

To O
further O
exemplify O
the O
proficiency O
of O
the O
attackers O
leveraging O
the O
Lamberts B-Tool
toolkit I-Tool
, O
deployment O
of O
Black B-Tool
Lambert I-Tool
included O
a O
rather O
sophisticated O
TTF O
zero B-Exp
day I-Exp
exploit I-Exp
, O
CVE-2014-4148 B-Exp
. O

Taking O
that O
into O
account O
, O
we O
classify O
the O
Lamberts B-Tool

the O

Named O
Trochilus B-Tool
, O
this O
new O
RAT B-Tool
was O
part O
of O
Group O
27 O
's O
malware O
portfolio O
that O
included O
six O
other O
malware O
strains O
, O
all O
served O
together O
or O
in O
different O
combinations O
, O
based O
on O
the O
data O
that O
needed O
to O
be O
stolen O
from O
each O
victim O
. O

According O
to O
the O
security O
experts O
, O
this O
collection O
of O
malware O
was O
discovered O
after O
their O
first O
initial O
report O
was O
published O
, O
meaning O
that O
Group O
27 O
ignored O
the O
fact O
they O
were O
unmasked O
and O
continued O
to O
infect O
their O
targets O
regardless O
, O
through O
the O
same O
entry O
point O
, O
the O
Myanmar O
Union O
Election O
Commission O
( O
UEC O
) O
website O
. O

Trochilus O
RAT O
activity O
was O
discovered O
during O
both O
months O
of O
October O
and O
November O
2015 O
. O

From O
September O
2016 O
through O
late O
November O
2016 O
, O
a O
threat O
actor O
group O
used O
both O
the O
Trochilus B-Tool
RAT I-Tool
and O
a O
newly O
idenfied O
RAT B-Tool
we've O
named O
MoonWind B-Tool
to O
target O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
, O
including O
a O
utility O
organization O
. O

We O
chose O
the O
name O
' O
MoonWind B-Tool
' O
based O
on O
debugging O
strings O
we O
saw O
within O
the O
samples O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
compiler O
used O
to O
generate O
the O
samples O
. O

The O
attackers O
compromised O
two O
legitimate B-Tool
Thai I-Tool
websites I-Tool
to O
host O
the O
malware O
, O
which O
is O
a O
tactic O
this O
group O
has O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Both O
the O
Trochilus B-Tool
and O
MoonWind B-Tool
RATs I-Tool
were O
hosted O
on O
the O
same O
compromised O
sites O
and O
used O
to O
target O
the O
same O
organization O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
attackers O
used O
different O
command B-Tool
and I-Tool
control I-Tool
servers I-Tool
( O
C2s O
) O
for O
each O
malware O
family O
, O
a O
tactic O
we O
believe O
was O
meant O
to O
thwart O
attempts O
to O
tie O
the O
attacks O
together O
using O
infrastructure O
alone O
. O

Further O
research O
led O
us O
to O
additional O
MoonWind B-Tool
samples I-Tool
using O
the O
same O
C2 O
( O
dns.webswindows.com O
) O
but O
hosted O
on O
a O
different O
compromised O
but O
legitimate B-Tool
website I-Tool
. O

The O
attacks O
in O
that O
case O
took O
place O
in O
late O
September O
to O
early O
October O
2016 O
and O
the O
attackers O
stored O
the O
MoonWind B-Tool
samples I-Tool
as O
RAR B-Tool
files I-Tool
, O
while O
in O
the O
November O
attacks O
the O
RATs B-Tool
were O
stored O
as O
executables O
. O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
additional O
tools O
, O
but O
the O
attackers O
again O
compromised O
a O
legitimate O
Thai O
website O
to O
host O
their O
malware O
, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
student O
portal O
for O
a O
Thai O
University O
. O

Trochilus B-Tool
was O
first O
reported O
by O
Arbor O
Networks O
in O
their O
Seven O
Pointed O
Dagger O
report O
tying O
its O
use O
to O
other O
targeted O
Southeast O
Asia O
activity O
. O

The O
activity O
dates O
to O
at O
least O
2013 O
and O
has O
ties O
to O
multiple O
reports O
by O
other O
researchers O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
MoonWind B-Tool
is O
yet O
another O
new O
tool O
being O
used O
by O
the O
group O
or O
groups O
responsible O
for O
that O
activity O
, O
indicating O
they O
are O
not O
only O
still O
active O
but O
continuing O
to O
evolve O
their O
playbook O
. O

The O
samples O
provided O
were O
alleged O
to O
be O
targeting O
Tibetan O
and O
Chinese O
Pro-Democracy O
Activists O
. O

On O
June O
7 O
, O
2013 O
, O
Rapid7 O
released O
an O
analysis O
of O
malware O
dubbed O
' O
KeyBoy B-Tool
' O
, O
also O
exploiting O
unknown O
vulnerabilities O
in O
Microsoft O
Office O
, O
similarly O
patched O
by O
MS12-060 B-Tool
, O
but O
allegedly O
targeting O
interests O
in O
Vietnam O
and O
India O
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
some O
previous O
targeted O
malware O
attacks O
, O
the O
attackers O
in O
this O
incident O
are O
taking O
advantage O
of O
services O
like O
changeip.com O
to O
establish O
free O
subdomains O
in O
their O
infrastructure O
. O

Blending O
in O
with O
legitimate B-Tool
traffic I-Tool
is O
a O
common O
tactic O
used O
by O
attackers O
to O
help O
fly O
under O
the O
radar O
. O

Subdomains O
at O
phmail.us O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
malicious O
activity O
dating O
back O
as O
far O
as O
December O
2011 O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
patterns O
of O
subdomain O
registration O
over O
time O
in O
DNS O
, O
TRAC O
believes O
this O
is O
an O
example O
where O
the O
attackers O
registered O
their O
own O
second-level O
domain O
. O

In O
this O
blog O
post O
we'll O
analyze O
two O
specific O
incidents O
apparently O
targeting O
victims O
in O
Vietnam O
and O
in O
India O
and O
we'll O
describe O
the O
capabilities O
of O
the O
custom O
backdoor B-Tool
being O
used O
that O
for O
convenience O
( O
and O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
an O
existing O
name O
) O
we O
call O
KeyBoy B-Tool
, O
due O
to O
a O
string O
present O
in O
one O
of O
the O
samples O
. O

We O
encountered O
the O
first O
document O
exploit O
called O
" O
THAM O
luan O
- O
GD O
- O
NCKH2.doc O
" O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
leveraging O
some O
vulnerabilities O
patched O
with O
MS12-060 B-Tool
. O

This O
document O
, O
written O
in O
Vietnamese O
, O
appears O
to O
be O
reviewing O
and O
discussing O
best O
practices O
for O
teaching O
and O
researching O
scientific O
topics O
. O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
this O
analysis O
we'll O
take O
the O
Vietnamese B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
as O
an O
example O
; O
the O
one O
found O
in O
the O
Indian O
attack O
operates O
in O
the O
exact O
same O
way O
. O

In O
the O
second O
set O
they O
are O
making O
use O
of O
a O
dynamic B-Tool
DNS I-Tool
service I-Tool

operations O
against O
Tibetan O
non-governmental O
organizations O
( O
NGOs O
) O
that O
also O
targeted O
Falun O

Uyghur O
groups O
. O

More O
recently O
in O
2016 O
, O
Arbor O
Networks O
reported O
on O
connected O
malware O
operations O
continuing O
to O
target O
these O
same O
groups O
, O
which O
the O
Communist O
Party O
of O
China O
perceives O
as O
a O
threat O
to O
its O
power O
. O

There O
is O
the O
exploit O
code O
and O
malware O
used O
to O
gain O
access O
to O
systems O
, O
the O
infrastructure O
that O
provides O
command O

control O
to O
the O

and O
the O
human O
elements O

, O
operators O
who O
deploy O
it O
, O
and O
analysts O
who O
extract O
value O
from O
the O
stolen O
information O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
frequent O
reuse O
of O
older O
( O
patched O
) O
exploits O
in O
malware O
operations O
against O
the O
Tibetan O
community O
. O

These O
operations O
involved O
highly O
targeted O
email B-Tool
lures I-Tool
with O
repurposed O
content O
and O
attachments O
that O
contained O
an O
updated O
version O
of O
KeyBoy B-Tool
. O

In O
August O
and O
October O
2016 O
we O
observed O
a O
malware O
operation O
targeting O
members O
of O
the O
Tibetan O
Parliament O
( O
the O
highest O
legislative O
organ O
of O
the O
Tibetan O
government O
in O
exile O
, O
formally O
known O
as O
Central O
Tibetan O
Administration O
) O
. O

The O
Arbor O
report O
describes O
the O
ongoing O
use O
of O
these O
four O
vulnerabilities O
in O
a O
series O
of O
espionage O
campaigns O
against O
not O
only O
Tibetan O
groups O
, O
but O
also O
others O
related O
to O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
Taiwan O
, O
and O
Uyghur O
interests O
. O

The O
malware O
samples O
deployed O
in O
both O
of O
these O
operations O
are O
updated O
versions O
of O
the O
KeyBoy B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
first O
discussed O
in O
2013 O
by O
Rapid7 O
. O

This O
behavioural O
tactic O
was O
previously O
mentioned O
in O
relation O
to O
KeyBoy B-Tool
in O
a O
2013 O
blog O
post O
by O
Cisco O
. O

These O
versions O
of O
KeyBoy B-Tool
differed O
from O
the O
one O
first O
described O
by O
Rapid7 O
in O
several O
ways O
, O
many O
of O
which O
will O
be O
described O
in O
the O
sections O
to O
follow O
. O

These O
samples O
were O
contained O
in O
exploit O
documents O
containing O
distinct O
lure O
content O
, O
one O
having O
a O
Tibetan O
nexus O
, O
the O
other O
an O
Indian O
nexus O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
2013 O
, O
2015 O
, O
and O
2016 O
KeyBoy B-Tool
samples I-Tool
provide O
evidence O
of O
a O
development O
effort O
focused O
on O
changing O
components O
that O
would O
be O
used O
by O
researchers O
to O
develop O
detection O
signatures O
. O

In O
another O
modification O
, O
first O
observed O
in O
the O
most O
recent O
October O
11 O
Parliamentarian O
operation O
( O
version O
agewkassif O
) O
, O
the O
developer O
(s O
) O
of O
KeyBoy B-Tool
began O
using O
a O
string B-Tool
obfuscation I-Tool
routine I-Tool
in O
order O
to O
hide O
many O
of O
the O
critical O
values O
referenced O
within O
the O
malware O
. O

Trend O
Micro O
specifically O
noted O
that O
the O
2013 O
versions O
of O
KeyBoy B-Tool
used O
the O
same O
algorithm O
for O
encoding O
their O
configuration O
files O
as O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
Operation O
Tropic O
Trooper O
malware O
. O

This O
sample O
was O
also O
found O
to O
be O
deployed O
using O
the O
CVE-2012-0158 B-Exp
vulnerability O
. O

The O
operation O
against O
the O
Tibetan O
Parliamentarians O
illustrates O
the O
continued O
use O
of O
malicious O
attachments O
in O
the O
form O
of O
documents B-Tool
bearing I-Tool
exploits I-Tool
. O

Chances O
are O
about O
even O
, O
though O
, O
that O
Mofang B-HackOrg
is O
a O
relevant O
threat O
actor O
to O
any O
organization O
that O
invests O
in O
Myanmar O
or O
is O
otherwise O
politically O
involved O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
campaign O
in O
Myanmar O
, O
Mofang B-HackOrg
has O
been O
observed O
to O
attack O
targets O
across O
multiple O
sectors O
( O
government O
, O
military O
, O
critical O
infrastructure O
and O
the O
automotive O
and O
weapon O
industries O
) O
in O
multiple O
countries O
. O

This O
threat O
report O
gives O
insight O
into O
some O
of O
the O
information O
that O
Fox-IT O
has O
about O
a O
threat O
actor O
that O
it O
follows O
, O
called O
Mofang B-HackOrg
. O

The O
name O
Mofang B-HackOrg
is O
based O
on O
the O
Mandarin O
verb O
, O
which O
means O
to O
imitate O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
the O
Mofang B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
is O
a O
group O
that O
operates O
out O
of O
China O
and O
is O
probably O
government-affiliated O
. O

Chapter O
7 O
explains O
the O
working O
of O
Mofang O
's O
preferred O
tools O
: O
ShimRat B-Tool
and O
SimRatReporter B-Tool
. O

The O
Mofang B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
has O
been O
active O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
Kyaukphyu O
sez O
. O

KeyBoy B-Tool
provides O
basic O
backdoor O
functionality O
, O
allowing O
the O
operators O
to O
select O
from O
various O
capabilities O
used O
to O
surveil O
and O
steal O
information O
from O
the O
victim O
machine O
. O

The O
first O
attack O
started O
in O
early O
July O
with O
a O
ShimRatReporter O
payload O
. O

Myanmar O
has O
been O
the O
target O
of O
Mofang B-HackOrg
's O
attacks O
for O
years O
before O
the O
campaign O
related O
to O
the O
sez O
. O

In O
late O
September O
2015 O
Mofang B-HackOrg
used O
the O
website O
of O
Myanmar O
's O
national O
airline O
hosted O
at O
www.flymna.com O
for O
an O
attack O
against O
an O
organization O
in O
Myanmar O
. O

In O
December O
2012 O
Mofang O
started O
a O
campaign O
against O
a O
new O
target O
, O
called O
' O
seg O
' O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
report O
. O

From O
the O
configuration O
it O
can O
be O
determined O
that O
the O
company O
was O
running O
F-Secure B-Tool
Antivirus I-Tool
and O
Mofang B-Tool
registered O
the O
domain O
to O
not O
appear O
suspicious O
. O

In O
September O
2015 O
Mofang B-HackOrg
launched O
another O
attack O
. O

A O
new O
version O
of O
ShimRat B-Tool
was O
built O
on O
the O
7th O
of O
September O
, O
uploaded O
to O
the O
server O
and O
only O
days O
later O
used O
in O
a O
new O
campaign O
. O

MoneyTaker O
has O
primarily O
been O
targeting O
card O
processing O
systems O
, O
including O
the O
AWS O
CBR O
( O
Russian O
Interbank O
System O
) O
and O
purportedly O
SWIFT O
( O
US O
) O
. O

Given O
the O
wide O
usage O
of O
STAR O
in O
LATAM O
, O
financial O
institutions O
in O
LATAM O
could O
have O
particular O
exposure O
to O
a O
potential O
interest O
from O
the O
MoneyTaker B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
. O

In O
addition O
to O
banks O
, O
the O
MoneyTaker B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
has O
attacked O
law O
firms O
and O
also O
financial O
software O
vendors O
. O

Since O
that O
time O
, O
the O
group O
attacked O

has O
been O
active O
since O
as O
early O

2004 O
; O
however O
, O
the O
highest O
volume O
of O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
NetTraveler B-Tool
toolkit I-Tool
was O
able O
to O
install O
additional O
info-stealing O

In O
this O

it O
was O
a O

, O
which O
was O
coined O
by O

and O
using O
Poison B-Tool

which O
was O
not O

Since O
at O

2013 O
, O
Nitro O
appears O
to O
have O
somewhat O
modified O
their O
malware O
and O

Of O

we've O
tied O

another O
Spindest B-Tool

and O
had O
the O

As O
this O
post O

, O
APT O

will O
continue O

Attacks O
on O
the O
chemical O
industry O
are O
merely O
their O
latest O
attack O
wave O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
attackers O
appears O
to O
be O
to O
collect O
intellectual O
property O
such O
as O
design O
documents O
, O
formulas O
, O
and O
manufacturing O
processes O
. O

The O
attack O
wave O
started O
in O
late O
July O
2011 O
and O
continued O
into O
midSeptember O
2011 O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
attacks O
appears O
to O
be O
industrial O
espionage O
, O
collecting O
intellectual O
property O
for O
competitive O
advantage O
. O

They O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
motor O
industry O
in O
late O
May O
. O

From O
late O
April O
to O
early O
May O
, O
the O
attackers O
focused O
on O
human O
rights O
related O
NGOs O
. O

Attackers O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
motor O
industry O
in O
late O
May O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
current O
attack O
campaign O
against O
the O
chemical O
industry O
began O
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
researched O
desired O
targets O
and O
then O
sent O
an O
email O
specifically O
to O
the O
target O
. O

First O
, O
when O
a O
specific O
recipient O
was O
targeted O
, O
the O
mails O
often O
purported O
to O
be O
meeting O
invitations O
from O
established O
business O
partners O
. O

While O
the O
attackers O
used O
different O
pretexts O
when O
sending O
these O
malicious O
emails O
, O
two O
methodologies O
stood O
out O
. O

Secondly O
, O
when O
the O
emails O
were O
being O
sent O
to O
a O
broad O
set O
of O
recipients O
, O
the O
mails O
purported O
to O
be O
a O
necessary O
security O
update O
. O

The O
attacks O
were O
traced O
back O
to O
a O
computer O
system O
that O
was O
a O
virtual O
private O
server O
( O
VPS B-Tool

located O
in O
the O
United O

. O

Attackers O
are O

malicious O

which O
use O

This O
attack O
campaign O
focused O
on O
the O
chemical O
sector O
with O
the O
goal O
of O
obtaining O
sensitive O
documents O
such O
as O
proprietary O
designs O
, O

, O
and O

processes O
. O

These O
have O
been O
highly O
active O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
region O
and O
unveiled O
ongoing O
targeted O
attacks O
in O
multiple O
regions O
. O

The O
attackers O
try O
to O
lure O
targets O
through O
spear O
phishing O
emails O
that O
include O
compressed O
executables O
. O

We O
found O
that O
the O
group O
behind O
this O
campaign O
targeted O
mainly O
industrial O
, O
engineering O
and O
manufacturing O
organizations O
in O
more O
than O
30 O
countries O
. O

Using O

and O

we O
were O
able O
to O
trace O
the O

back O
to O
March O

Operation O
Ghoul O
is O
one O
of O
the O
many O
attacks O
in O
the O
wild O
targeting O
industrial O
, O
manufacturing O
and O
engineering O
organizations O
, O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
recommends O
users O
to O
be O
extra O
cautious O
while O
checking O
and O
opening O
emails O
and O
attachments O
. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation O
Groundbait O
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks O
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government O
separatists O
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People's O
Republics O
. O

The O
attacks O
appear O
to O
be O
geopolitically O
motivated O
and O
target O
high O
profile O
organizations O
. O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
attacks O
is O
clearly O
espionage O
– O
they O
involve O
gaining O
access O
to O
top O
legislative O
, O
executive O
and O
judicial O
bodies O
around O
the O
world O
. O

The O
attackers O
have O
targeted O
a O
large O
number O
of O
organizations O
globally O
since O
early O
2017 O
, O
with O
the O
main O
focus O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
North O
Africa O
( O
MENA O
) O
, O
especially O
Palestine O
. O

The O
attacks O
were O
initially O
discovered O
while O
investigating O
a O
phishing O
attack O
that O
targeted O
political O
figures O
in O
the O
MENA O
region O
. O

Like O
BlackEnergy B-Tool
( O

mostly O
in O
Ukraine O
and O
a O
number O
of O
other O
CIS O
countries O
, O
including O
Russia O
, O
Georgia O
and O
Belarus O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
increase O
in O
Potao B-Tool
detections O
in O
2014 O
and O
2015 O
were O
infections O
through O
USB O

. O

The O
first O
Potao O
campaign O
that O
we O
examined O
took O
place O
in O
August O
2011 O
. O

In O
March O
2014 O
, O
the O
gang O
behind O
Potao B-Tool
started O
using O
a O
new O
infection B-Tool
vector I-Tool
. O

Since O
March O
2015 O
, O
ESET O
has O
detected O
Potao B-Tool
binaries O
at O
several O
high-value O
Ukrainian O
targets O
that O
include O
government O
and O
military O
entities O
and O
one O
of O
the O
major O
Ukrainian O

One O
of O
the O

In O
August O

warned O
state-owned O

of O
the O
state-sponsored O

The O
new O
threat O

group O
was O
eventually O
named O
Silence O

also O
able O

However O
, O
some O

were O
sent O
to O
bank O
employees O
in O
more O
than O
25 O
countries O
of O
Central O

In O
September O
2017 O
, O
we O
discovered O
Silence O
attack O
on O
financial O
institutions O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
a O
spear-phishing O
email O
with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence O
attack O
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking O
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing O
emails O
from O
the O
addresses O
of O
real O
bank O
employees O
and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O
victims O
. O

The O
spear-phishing O
infection O
vector O
is O
still O
the O
most O
popular O
way O
to O
initiate O
targeted O
campaigns O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O
attack O
is O
Silence O
group O
, O
a O
relatively O
new O
threat O
actor O
that's O
been O
operating O
since O
mid-2016 O
. O

A O
preliminary O
analysis O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
our O
Threat O
Analysis O
and O
Intelligence O
team O
as O
it O
yielded O
interesting O
data O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
shows O
that O
Silence O
was O
targeting O
employees O
from O
financial O
entities O
, O
specifically O
in O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
and O
the O
Republic O
of O
Belarus O
. O

As O
shown O
above O
, O
the O
threat O
runs O
several O
native B-Tool
binaries I-Tool
to O
collect O
useful O
information O
for O
its O
recon O
phase O
. O

The O
intelligence O
we O
have O
collected O
shows O
that O
Silence O
is O
part O
of O
a O
more O
extensive O
operation O
, O
still O
focused O
on O
financial O
institutions O
operating O
mainly O
on O
Russian O
territory O
. O

These O
spearphishing O
attempts O
represent O
an O
evolution O
of O
Iranian O
actors O
based O
on O
their O
social O
engineering O
tactics O
and O
narrow O
targeting O
. O

Based O
on O
file O
modification O
dates O
and O
timestamps O
of O
samples O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
observed O
campaign O
was O
initiated O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
February O
2016 O
, O
with O
the O
infrastructure O
taken O
offline O
at O
the O
start O
of O
March O
. O

While O
the O
Sima O
moniker O
could O
similarly O
originate O
from O
software O
labels O
, O
it O
is O
a O
common O
female O
Persian O
name O
and O
a O
Persian-language O
word O
for O
" O
visage O
" O
or O
" O
appearance O
" O
. O

Given O
its O
use O
in O
more O
advanced O
social O
engineering O
campaigns O
against O
women O
's O
rights O
activists O
, O
the O
label O
seem O
particularly O
apt O
. O

Samples O
and O
resource O
names O
contained O
the O
family O
names O
of O
prominent O
Iranians O
, O
and O
several O
of O
these O
individuals O
received O
the O
malware O
located O
in O
their O
respective O
folder O
. O

The O
Sima B-HackOrg
group O
also O
engaged O
in O
impersonation O
of O
Citizenship O
and O
Immigration O
Services O
at O
the O
Department O
of O
Homeland O
Security O
, O
posing O
as O
a O
notice O
about O
the O
expiration O
of O
the O
recipient O
's O
Permanent O
Residence O
status O
. O

In O
another O
case O
, O
Sima B-HackOrg
mirrored O
an O
announcement O
made O
about O
the O
broadcast O
of O
a O
television O
program O
on O
Iranian-American O
cultural O
affairs O
in O
order O
to O
impersonate O
the O
individual O
and O
engage O
in O
spearphishing O
within O
hours O
of O
the O
legitimate O
message O
. O

The O
server O
used O
to O
host O
these O
malware O
samples O
was O
located O
on O
the O
German O
provider O
Hetzner O
( O
148.251.55.114 O
) O
, O
within O
a O
small O
block O
of O
IP O
addresses O
that O
are O
registered O
with O
the O
customer O
ID O
" O
HOS-156205 O
" O
. O

All O
the O
samples O
appear O
to O
be O
have O
been O
compiled O
between O
February O
29 O
and O
March O
1 O
2016 O
, O
shortly O
before O
our O
discovery O
, O
suggesting O
that O
, O
despite O
the O
known O
C&C O
servers O
having O
quickly O
gone O
offline O
shortly O
after O
, O
this O
spree O
of O
attacks O
might O
be O
fresh O
and O
currently O
undergoing O
. O

These O
archives O
provide O
further O
indication O
that O
those O
entities O
behind O
the O
campaigns O
are O
Persian-language O
speakers O
, O
due O
to O
the O
naming O
of O
files O
and O
folders O
in O
Persian O
. O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
narrative O
we O
are O
going O
to O
focus O
exclusively O
to O
those O
samples O
we O
identified O
being O
used O
in O
attacks O
against O
Iranian O
civil O
society O
and O
diaspora O
. O

Butterfly B-HackOrg
has O
attacked O
multi-billion O
dollar O
companies O
operating O
in O
the O
internet O
, O
IT O
software O
, O
pharmaceutical O
, O
and O
commodities O
sectors O
. O

The O
first O
signs O
of O
Butterfly O
's O
activities O
emerged O
in O
early O
2013 O
when O
several O
major O
technology O
and O
internet O
firms O
were O
compromised O
. O

However O
, O
an O
investigation O
by O
Symantec O
has O
found O
that O
the O
group O
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O
least O
March O
2012 O
and O
its O
attacks O
have O
not O
only O
continued O
to O
the O
present O
day O
, O
but O
have O
also O
increased O
in O
number O
. O

Symantec O
has O
to O
date O
discovered O
49 O
different O
organizations O
in O
more O
than O
20 O
countries O
that O
have O
been O
attacked O
by O
Butterfly O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
four O
companies O
which O
have O
publicly O
acknowledged O
attacks O
, O
Symantec O
has O
identified O
five O
other O
large O
technology O
firms O
compromised O
by O
Butterfly O
, O
primarily O
headquartered O
in O
the O
US O
. O

In O
the O
first O
attack O
, O
Butterfly O
gained O
a O
foothold O
by O
first O
attacking O
a O
small O
European O
office O
belonging O
to O
one O
firm O
and O
using O
this O
infection O
to O
then O
move O
on O
to O
its O
US O
office O
and O
European O
headquarters O
. O

However O
, O
technology O
is O
not O
the O
only O
sector O
the O
group O
has O
focused O
on O
and O
Symantec O
has O
found O
evidence O
that O
Butterfly O
has O
attacked O
three O
major O
European O
pharmaceutical O
firms O
. O

Butterfly B-HackOrg
has O
also O
shown O
an O
interest O
in O
the O
commodities O
sector O
, O
attacking O
two O
major O
companies O
involved O
in O
gold O
and O
oil O
in O
late O
2014 O
. O

The O
company O
specializes O
in O
finance O
and O
natural O

specific O
to O
that O
region O
. O

The O
latter O
was O
one O
of O
at O
least O
three O
law O
firms O
Butterfly B-HackOrg
has O
targeted O
over O
the O
past O
three O
years O
. O

In O
many O

, O
the O

has O
succeeded O
in O
compromising O
Microsoft B-Tool

Lotus B-Tool

For O
example O
, O
Bisonal B-HackOrg
malware I-HackOrg
in O
2012 O
used O

to O
communicate O

This O
Bisonal O
variant O

in O
the O

Previous O
reports O
have O
discussed O
Bisonal O
malware O
used O
in O
attacks O
against O
Japan O
, O
South O
Korea O
and O
Russia O
. O

This O
particular O
sample O
we O
found O
targeted O
an O
organization O
in O
Russia O
and O
there O
is O
a O
specific O
system O
language O
check O
for O
Cyrillic O
and O
no O
others O
. O

If O
it's O
Cyrillic B-Tool
and O
the O
command O
to O
the O
shell O
is O
not O
‘ipconfig’ O
, O
the O
threat O
converts O
the O
command O
result O
text O
encoding O
from O
Cyrillic O
to O
UTF-16 B-Tool
. O

Similar O
to O
the O
Bisonal O
variant O
targeting O
the O
Russian O
organization O
, O
this O
sample O
was O
also O
disguised O
as O
PDF O
document O
. O

The O
contents O
of O
the O
decoy O
PDF O
is O
a O
job O
descriptions O
with O
the O
South O
Korean O
Coast O
Guard O
. O

The O
installed O
EXE O
file O
is O
almost O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
the O
DLL O
version O
of O
Bisonal O
variant O
used O
against O
the O
Russian O
organization O
. O

The O
targets O
are O
military O
or O
defense O
industry O
in O
particular O
countries O
, O
O
it O
used O
DDNS O
for O
C2 O
servers O
, O
and O
tracked O
connections O
from O
their O
victims O
by O
using O
target O
or O
campaign O
codes O
, O
O
as O
well O
as O
disguising O
the O
malware O
as O
document O
file O
, O
and O
using O
a O
dropper B-Tool
to O
install O
the O
malware O
and O
decoy O
file O
. O

A O
previous O
campaign O
of O
this O
APT O
group O
was O
uncovered O
by O
Talos O
in O
June O
2017 O
, O
and O
since O
then O
very O
little O
of O
this O
operation O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
wild O
. O

ined O
in O
the O
archive O
is O
called O
DriverInstallerU.exe” O
but O
its O
metadata O
shows O
that O
its O
original O
name O
is O
O
Interenet O
Assistant.exe” O
. O

After O
reviewing O
all O
the O
malware O
functionalities O
, O
O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
look O
for O
victims O
who O
answer O
well-defined O
characteristics O
and O
believe O
that O
further O
stages O
of O
the O
attack O
are O
delivered O
only O
to O
those O
who O
fit O
the O
specific O
victim O
profile O
. O

In O
this O
sample O
, O
however O
, O
the O
module O
names O
were O
changed O
from O
actors O
and O
characters’ O
names O
to O
car O
models O
, O
namely O
BMW_x1” O
, O
BMW_x2” O
and O
up O
to O
BMW_x8” O
. O

But O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
known O
affection O
for O
decoy O
documents O
that O
pose O
as O
news O
summaries O
, O
O
we O
were O
able O
to O
date O
the O
campaign O
back O
to O
March O
2018 O
. O

With O
the O
experience O
gained O
from O
the O
APT O
attack O
that O
began O
in O
March O
2017 O
, O
it O
seems O
this O
campaign O
has O
evolved O
into O
an O
attack O
with O
new O
capabilities O
, O
and O
an O
even O
more O
specific O
target O
, O
over O
a O
year O
later O
. O

These O
unknown B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
continued O
launching O
DDoS O
attacks O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

For O
simplicity O
, O
Kaspersky O
is O
calling O
them O
the O
BlackEnergy I-HackOrg
APT O
group O
. O

Since O
the O
middle O
of O
2015 O
, O
O
one O
of O
the O
preferred O
attack O
vectors O
for O
BlackEnergy B-HackOrg
in O
Ukraine O
has O
been O
Excel O
documents O
with O
macros O
that O
drop O
the O
Trojan O
to O
disk O
if O
the O
user O
chooses O
to O
run O
the O
script O
in O
the O
document O
. O

A O
very O
good O
analysis O
and O
overview O
of O
the O
BlackEnergy O
attacks O
in O
Ukraine O
throughout O
2014 O
and O
2015 O
was O
published O
by O
the O
Ukrainian O

the O

is O
only O
available O
in O
Russian O
for O
now O
, O
O
but O
can O
be O
read O
via O
Google O
Translate O
. O

The O
earliest O
signs O
of O
destructive O
payloads O
with O
BlackEnergy B-HackOrg
go O
back O
as O
far O
as O
June O
2014 O
. O

BlackEnergy B-HackOrg
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
threat O
actor O
and O
the O
current O
attacks O
in O
Ukraine O
indicate O
that O
destructive O
actions O
are O
on O
their O
main O
agenda O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
industrial O
control O
installations O
and O
espionage O
activities O
. O

Kaspersky O
will O
continue O
to O
monitor O
the O
BlackEnergy B-HackOrg
attacks O
in O
Ukraine O
and O
update O
our O
readers O
with O
more O
data O
when O
available O
. O

From O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
perpetrating O
cybercrime O
for O
financial O
gain O
, O
O
its O
toolset O
has O
been O
expanded O
with O
malware O
used O
to O
conduct O
espionage O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
and O
Central O
Asia O
. O

Throughout O
our O
tracking O
, O
O
we've O
seen O
this B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
deploy O
its O
main O
backdoor O
as O
well O
as O
other O
tools O
against O
various O
victims O
, O
but O
June O
2019 O
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
saw O
the O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
group O
use O
a O
zero-day O
exploit O
as O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
. O

In O
that O
case O
, O
O
we O
observed O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
using O
a O
local O
privilege O
escalation O
exploit O
, O
CVE-2019-1132 B-Exp
, O
against O
one O
of O
its O
victims O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
shift O
in O
targets O
occurred O
before O
the O
source O
code O
leak O
, O
O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O
same O
people O
behind O
the O
first O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
malware O
attacks O
against O
businesses O
and O
banks O
are O
also O
involved O
in O
targeting O
governmental O
institutions O
. O

When O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
was O
targeting O
businesses O
, O
the O
decoy O
documents O
would O
typically O
be O
contracts O
or O
invoices O
. O

The O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
group O
is O
well O
known O
for O
its O
targeting O
of O
financial O
institutions O
and O
businesses O
in O
Russia O
. O

Figure O
2 O
is O
a O
typical O
example O
of O
a O
generic O
invoice O
the O
group B-HackOrg
used O
in O
a O
campaign O
in O
2014 O
. O

When O
the O
group's B-HackOrg
focus O
shifted O
to O
banks O
, O
O
the O
decoy O
documents O
were O
related O
to O
banking O
system O
regulations O
or O
advisories O
from O
FinCERT O
, O
O
an O
organization O
created O
by O
the O
Russian O
government O
to O
provide O
help O
and O
guidance O
to O
its O
financial O
institutions O
. O

We O
confirmed O
that O
this O
is O
a O
DarkHydrus B-HackOrg
Group's O
new O
attack O
targeting O
Middle O
East O
region O
. O

In O
July O
2018 O
, O
O
Palo O
Alto O
disclosed O
DarkHydrus B-HackOrg
Group O
which O
showed O
its O
special O
interest O
to O

. O

Prior O
to O
that O
report O
, O
O
we O

exploiting O
CVE-2018-8414 B-Exp
vulnerability O
(remote O
code O
execution O
in O
SettingContent-ms) O
, O
O
which O
is O
believed O
a O
work O
of O
DarkHydrus B-HackOrg
. O

However O
, O
O
the O
final O
payload O
is O
something O
that O
welivesecurity O
have O
never O
seen O
associated O
with O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg

It's O

that O

ASERT O
uncovered O
a O
credential O
theft O
campaign O
we O
call O
LUCKY B-HackOrg
ELEPHANT I-HackOrg
where O
attackers O
masquerade O
as O
legitimate O
entities O
such O
as O
foreign O
government O
, O
telecommunications O
, O
and O
military O
. O

From O
at O

February O
2019 O
to O
present O
, O
O
the O
actors O
in O
the O
LUCKY B-HackOrg
ELEPHANT I-HackOrg
campaign O
copied O
webpages O
to O
mimic O
South O
Asian O
government O
websites O
as O
well O
as O
Microsoft O
Outlook O
365 O
login O
pages O
and O
hosted O
them O
on O
their O
own O
doppelganger O
domains O
, O
O
presumably O
to O
trick O
victims O
into O
providing O
login O
credentials O
. O

ASERT O
suspects O
that O
the O
Actors O
use O
phishing O
emails O
to O
lure O
victims O
to O
the O
doppelganger O
websites O
and O
entice O
users O
to O
enter O
their O

. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
one O
domain O
, O
O
yahoomail[.]cf O
is O
only O
associated O
with O
this O
group B-HackOrg
from O
February O
2019 O
onward O
. O

In O
late O
2018 O
, O
O
the O
domain O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
different O
APT B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
/ O
campaign O
of O
Chinese O
origin O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
into O
the O
activity O
, O
O
ASERT O
deems O
with O
moderate O
confidence O
that O
an O
Indian B-HackOrg
APT I-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
is O
behind O
the O
LUCKY O
ELEPHANT O
campaign O
. O

The O
targets O
are O
typical O
of O

O

The O
heavier O

adheres O
to O
historical O
targeting O
and O
the O
ongoing O
tension O
between O
the O
two O

O
which O
has O
escalated O
since O

, O
O
it O

is O
that O

, O
O
who O
is O
mainly O

for O

. O

At O

More O
recently O
, O
O
Lazarus B-HackOrg

, O
O
including O
an O

, O
known O
as O

has O
enabled O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
to O
fraudulently O
empty O

, O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
inject O

It O
was O
previously O
believed O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
used O
scripts B-Tool
to O
manipulate O
legitimate O
software O
on O
the O
server O
into O
enabling O
the O
fraudulent O

. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
has O
also O
become O
involved O
in O

. O

This O
malware B-Tool
in O

intercepts O
fraudulent O
Lazarus B-HackOrg

and O
sends O
fake O
approval O
responses O
, O
O
allowing O
the O
attackers O
to O
steal O

. O

Lazarus B-HackOrg
was O
linked O
to O
the O
$81 O

in O
2016 O
, O
along O
with O
a O
number O
of O
other O

. O

Lazarus B-HackOrg
was O
also O
linked O
to O
the O
WannaCry O
ransomware O
outbreak O
in O
May O
2017 O
. O

WannaCry O
incorporated O
the O
leaked O
EternalBlue O

that O
used O
two O
known O
vulnerabilities O
in O
Windows O
CVE-2017-0144 B-Exp
and O

to O
turn O
the O

into O
a O

, O
capable O
of O
spreading O
itself O
to O
any O

on O
the O
victim's O
network O

that O
saw O
large O

. O

In O
short O
, O
O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
continues O
to O
pose O
a O
serious O
threat O
to O
the O
financial O
sector O
and O
organizations O
should O
take O
all O
necessary O
steps O
to O
ensure O
that O
their O

are O
fully O
up O

As O
with O
the O
2016 O
series O
of O
virtual O
bank O
heists O
, O
O
including O
the O
Bangladesh O
Bank O
heist O
, O
O
FASTCash O
illustrates O
that O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
possesses O
an O
in-depth O
knowledge O
of O
banking O
systems O
and O
transaction O
processing O
protocols O
and O
has O
the O
expertise O
to O
leverage O
that O
knowledge O
in O
order O
to O
steal O
large O
sums O
from O
vulnerable O
banks O
. O

The O
attack B-HackOrg
, O
which O
starts O
with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
disguised O
as O
a O

, O
weaponizes O
TeamViewer B-Tool

As O
described O
in O
the O

, O
one O
of O

uses O
of O
the O
AutoHotKey O

is O
to O

from O
the O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
if O
there O
are O
geopolitical O
motives O
behind O
this O
campaign O
by O
looking O
solely O
at O
the O
list O
of O
countries O
it O
was O

, O
O
since O
it O
was O
not O
after O
a O

the O
victims O
came O
from O
different O
places O
in O
the O
world O
. O

The O
initial O
infection O
vector O
used O
by O
the O
threat O
actor O
also O
changed O
over O
time O
, O
during O
2018 O
we O
have O
seen O
multiple O
uses O
of O
self-extracting O
archives B-Tool
instead O
of O
malicious O
documents O
with O
AutoHotKey B-HackOrg
, O
which O
displayed O
a O
decoy B-Tool
image I-Tool
to O
the O
user O
. O

The O
recent O
wave O
of O
FASTCash O
attacks O
demonstrates O
that O
financially O
motivated O
attacks O
are O
not O
simply O
a O
passing O
interest O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
and O
can O
now O
be O
considered O
one O
of O
its O
core O
activities O
. O

Although O
both O
examples O
of O
the O
different O

an O

The O
Buckeye B-HackOrg
attack O
group O
had O
been O
active O
since O
at O
least O
2009 O
, O
when O
it O
began O
mounting O
a O
string O
of O
espionage O
attacks O
, O
mainly O
against O
organizations O
based O
in O
the O
U.S O
. O

These O
include O
CVE-2010-3962 B-Exp
as O
part O
of O
an O
attack O
campaign O
in O
2010 O
and O
CVE-2014-1776 B-Exp
in O
2014 O
. O

Beginning O
in O
August O
2016 O
, O
a O
group O
calling O
itself O
the O
Shadow B-HackOrg
Brokers I-HackOrg
began O
releasing O
tools O
it O
claimed O
to O
have O
originated O
from O
the O
Equation B-HackOrg
Group O
. O

Over O
the O
coming O
months O
, O
O
it O
progressively O
released O
more O
tools O
, O
O
until O
April O
2017 O
, O
O
when O
it O
released O
a O
final O
, O
large O
cache O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
the O
DoublePulsar B-Tool
backdoor B-Tool
, O
the O

, O
and O
the O
EternalBlue B-Tool
, O
EternalSynergy B-Tool
, O
and O
EternalRomance B-Tool
exploit B-Tool
tools B-Tool
. O

However O
, O
Buckeye B-HackOrg
had O
already O
been O
using O
some O
of O
these O
leaked B-Tool
tools I-Tool
at O
least O
a O
year O
beforehand O
. O

The O
earliest O
known O
use O
of O
Equation B-Tool
Group I-Tool
tools I-Tool
by O
Buckeye B-HackOrg
is O
March O
31 O
, O
2016 O
, O
during O
an O
attack O
on O
a O
target O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

Beginning O
in O
March O
2016 O
, O
Buckeye B-HackOrg
began O
using O
a O
variant O
of O
DoublePulsar O
(Backdoor.Doublepulsar) O
, O
a O
backdoor O
that O
was O
subsequently O
released O
by O
the O
Shadow B-HackOrg
Brokers I-HackOrg
in O
2017 O
. O

However O
, O
while O
activity O
involving O
known O
Buckeye B-HackOrg
tools O
ceased O
in O
mid-2017 O
, O
the O
Bemstour B-Tool
exploit I-Tool
tool I-Tool
and O
the O
DoublePulsar B-Tool
variant O
used O
by O
Buckeye O
continued O
to O
be O
used O
until O
at O
least O
September O
2018 O
in O
conjunction O
with O
different O
malware O
. O

During O
this O
attack O
, O
the O
Bemstour O
exploit O
tool O
was O
delivered O
to O
victims O
via O
known O
Buckeye B-Tool
malware I-Tool
(Backdoor.Pirpi) O
. O

One O
hour O
later O
, O
Bemstour O
was O
used O
against O
an O
educational O
institution O
in O
Belgium O
. O

Bemstour O
is O
specifically O
designed O
to O
deliver O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
DoublePulsar B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
. O

DoublePulsar O
is O
then O
used O
to O
inject O
a O
secondary O
payload O
, O
which O
runs O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

A O
significantly O
improved O
variant O
of O
the O
Bemstour O
exploit O
tool O
was O
rolled O
out O
in O
September O
2016 O
, O
O
when O
it O
was O
used O
in O
an O
attack O
against O
an O
educational O
institution O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

When O
used O
against O
32-bit O
targets O
, O
O
Bemstour B-Tool
still O
delivered O
the O
same O
DoublePulsar B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
. O

Bemstour O
was O
used O
again O
in O
June O
2017 O
in O
an O
attack O
against O
an O
organization O
in O
Luxembourg O
. O

Between O
June O
and O
September O
2017 O
, O
O
Bemstour O
was O
also O
used O
against O
targets O
in O
the O
Philippines O
and O
Vietnam O
. O

Development O
of O
Bemstour O
has O
continued O
into O
2019 O
. O

Unlike O
earlier O
attacks O
when O
Bemstour O
was O
delivered O
using O
Buckeye's O
Pirpi O
backdoor O
, O
in O
this O
attack O
Bemstour O
was O
delivered O
to O
the O
victim O
by O
a O
different B-Tool
backdoor B-Tool
Trojan O
(Backdoor.Filensfer) O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
sample O
of O
Bemstour O
seen O
by O
Symantec O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
compiled O
on O
March O
23 O
, O
2019 O
, O
eleven O
days O
after O
the O
zero-day O

was O
patched O
by O
Microsoft O
. O

Filensfer O
is O
a O
family O
of O
malware O
that O
has O
been O
used O
in O
targeted O
attacks O
since O
at O

2013 O
. O

The O
zero-day O
vulnerability O
found O
and O
reported O
by O
Symantec O
(CVE-2019-0703) B-Exp
occurs O
due O
to O
the O
way O
the O
Windows O
SMB O
Server O
handles O
certain O

. O

While O
Symantec O
has O
never O
observed O

(CVE-2019-0703) O
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
never O
used O
the O
FuzzBunch B-Tool
framework I-Tool
in O
its O

Furthermore O
, O
O
from O

O
we O
detected O

The O
story O
continued O
in O
late O
2016 O
, O
when O
we O
discovered O
a O
new O
, O
previously O
unknown O
backdoor B-Tool
that O
we O
named O
Okrum B-Tool

The O
malicious O

focused O
on O
the O

targets O
in O
Slovakia O
that O
were O
previously O
targeted O
by O
Ketrican O

We O
started O
connecting O
the O

when O
we O
discovered O
that O
the O

backdoor O
was O
used O
to O
drop O
a O
Ketrican O

, O
freshly O
compiled O
in O

In O
2017 O
, O
the O

entities O
that O
were O
affected O
by O
the O
Okrum O
malware O
and O
by O
the O
2015 O
Ketrican O

again O
became O
targets O
of O
the O
malicious O

. O

This O
time O
, O
the O
attackers O
used O
new O

According O
to O

The O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
behind O
the O
Sea O
Turtle O
campaign O
show O
clear O
signs O
of O
being O
highly O
capable O
and O
brazen O
in O
their O
endeavors O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
typically O
stop O
or O
slow O
down O
their O
activities O
once O
their O
campaigns O
are O
publicly O
revealed O
. O

The O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
behind O
the O
Sea O
Turtle O
campaign O
were O
successful O
in O
compromising O
entities O
by O
manipulating O
and O
falsifying O
DNS O
records O
at O
various O
levels O
in O
the O
domain O
name O
space O
. O

If O
an O
attacker B-HackOrg
was O
able O
to O
compromise O
an O
organization's O
network O
administrator O
credentials O
, O
the O
attacker O
would O
be O
able O
to O
change O
that O
particular O
organization's O
DNS O
records O
at O
will O
. O

If O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
one O
of O
these O
EPP O
keys O
, O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
modify O
any O
DNS O
records O
that O
were O
managed O
by O
that O
particular O
registrar O
. O

Captured O
legitimate O

when O

. O

The O
diagram O
below O
illustrates O
how O
we O
believe O
the O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea O
Turtle O
campaign O
used O
DNS O
hijacking O
to O
achieve O
their O
end O
goals O
. O

As O
of O
early O
2019 O
, O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
the O
spear-phishing O
threat B-HackOrg
vector I-HackOrg
came O
from O
a O
compromised O
organization's O
public O
disclosure O
. O

On O
January O
4 O
, O
Packet O
Clearing O
House O
, O
which O
is O
not O
an O
Internet O
exchange O
point O
but O
rather O
is O
an O
NGO O
which O
provides O
support O
to O
Internet O
exchange O
points O
and O
the O
core O
of O
the O
domain O
name O
system O
, O
provided O
confirmation O
of O
this O
aspect O
of O
the O
actors’ B-HackOrg
tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O
internal O
DNS O
had O
been O
briefly O
hijacked O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O
at O
its O
domain O
registrar O
. O

During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
would O
modify O
the O
NS O
records O
for O
the O
targeted O
organization O
, O
pointing O
users O
to O
a O
malicious O
DNS O
server O
that O
provided O
actor-controlled O
responses O
to O
all O
DNS O
queries O
. O

The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-Tool
servers I-Tool
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture O
user O
credentials O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
MitM B-Tool
server I-Tool
IP O
addresses O
published O
in O
previous O
reports O
, O
Talos O
identified O
16 O
additional B-Tool
servers I-Tool
leveraged O
by O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
during O
the O
observed O
attacks O
. O

The O
attackers B-HackOrg
would O
then O
use O
the O
certificate O
on O
actor-controlled O
servers O
to O
perform O
additional O
MitM B-Tool
operations O
to O
harvest O
additional O
credentials O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
redirected O
to O
these O
actor-controlled B-HackOrg
servers B-Tool
displaying O
the O
stolen O
certificate O
. O

One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' B-HackOrg
ability O
to O
impersonate O
VPN B-Tool
applications I-Tool
, O
such O
as O
Cisco O
Adaptive B-Tool
Security I-Tool
Appliance I-Tool
(ASA) O
products O
, O
to O
perform O
MitM O
attacks O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
found O
a O
new O
ASA B-Exp
exploit B-Exp
. O

Rather O
, O
they B-HackOrg
likely O
abused O
the O
trust O
relationship O
associated O
with O
the O
ASA's B-Tool
SSL O
certificate O
to O
harvest O
VPN O
credentials O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
victim's O
network O
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
DNS O
records O
indicate O
that O
a O
targeted O
domain O
resolved O
to O
an O
actor-controlled B-HackOrg
MitM B-Tool
server I-Tool
. O

In O
another O
case O
, O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
were O
able O
to O
compromise O
NetNod O
, O
a O
non-profit O
, O
independent O
internet O
infrastructure O
organization O
based O
in O
Sweden O
. O

Using O
this O
access O
, O
the O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
were O
able O
to O
manipulate O
the O
DNS O
records O
for O
sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net O
. O

This O
redirection O
allowed O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
to O
harvest O
credentials O
of O
administrators O
who O
manage O
domains O
with O
the O
TLD O
of O
Saudi O
Arabia O
(.sa) O
. O

In O
one O
of O
the O
more O
recent O
campaigns O
on O
March O
27 O
, O
2019 O
, O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
targeted O
the O
Sweden-based O
consulting O
firm O
Cafax O
. O

We O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Sea O
Turtle O
was O
targeted O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
re-establish O
access O
to O
the O
NetNod O
network O
, O
which O
was O
previously O
compromised O
by O
this O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
. O

Obtaining O
access O
to O
this O
ccTLD O
registrars O
would O
have O
allowed O
attackers B-HackOrg
to O
hijack O
any O
domain O
that O
used O
those O
ccTLDs O
. O

These O
actors B-HackOrg
perform O
DNS O
hijacking O
through O
the O
use O
of O
actor-controlled O
name B-Tool
servers I-Tool
. O

Sea B-HackOrg
Turtle I-HackOrg
have O
been O
more O
aggressive O
in O
their O
pursuit O
targeting O
DNS O
registries O
and O
a O
number O
of O
registrars O
, O
including O
those O
that O
manage O
ccTLDs O
. O

These O
actors B-HackOrg
use O
Let's O
Encrypts B-Tool
, O
Comodo B-Tool
, O
Sectigo B-Tool
, O
and O
self-signed B-Tool
certificates I-Tool
in O
their O
MitM B-Tool
servers I-Tool
to O
gain O
the O
initial O
round O
of O
credentials O
. O

These O
actors B-HackOrg
have O
been O
more O
aggressive O
in O
their O
pursuit O
targeting O
DNS O
registries O
and O
a O
number O
of O
registrars O
, O
including O
those O
that O
manage O
ccTLDs O
. O

Once O
they O
have O
access O
to O
the O
network O
, O
they B-HackOrg
steal O
the O
organization's O
legitimate O
SSL O
certificate O
and O
use O
it O
on O
actor-controlled B-Tool
servers B-Tool
. O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
Sea O
Turtle O
campaign O
continues O
to O
be O
highly O
successful O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Had O
more O
ccTLDs O
implemented O
security O
features O
such O
as O
registrar O
locks O
, O
attackers B-HackOrg
would O
be O
unable O
to O
redirect O
the O
targeted O
domains O
. O

The O
attackers B-HackOrg
stole O
organizations' O
SSL O
certificates O
associated O
with O
security O
appliances O
such O
as O
ASA B-Tool
to O
obtain O
VPN O
credentials O
, O
allowing O
the O
actors O
to O
gain O
access O
to O
the O
targeted O
network O
. O

The O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
were O
able O
to O
maintain O
long O
term O
persistent O
access O
to O
many O
of O
these O
networks O
by O
utilizing O
compromised O
credentials O
. O

Cisco O
Talos O
will O
continue O
to O
monitor O
Sea O
Turtle O
and O
work O
with O
our O
partners O
to O
understand O
the O
threat O
as O
it O
continues O
to O
evolve O
to O
ensure O
that O
our O
customers O
remain O
protected O
and O
the O
public O
is O
informed O
. O

If O
the O
user O
enables O
macro O
to O
open O
the O
xlsm B-Tool

, O
it O
will O
then O
drop O
the O
legitimate O
script O
engine O
AutoHotkey O
along O
with O
a O
malicious O

file O
. O

Create O
a O
link O
file O
in O
the O
startup O
folder O
for O
AutoHotkeyU32.exe O
, O
allowing O
the O
attack O
to O
persist O
even O
after O
a O
system O
restart O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
one O
of O
these O
files O
also O
enables O
the O

a O
remote O
access O

that O
gives O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
remote O
control O
over O
the O

Such O
attacks O
highlight O
the O
need O
for O
caution O
before O
downloading O

from O
unknown O

and O
enabling O
macro O
for O

The O

We O
assess O
that O

with O
the O
primary O
goal O
of O
enabling O
secondary O

in O
July O
2018 O
. O

That O
attack O
was O
attributed O
to O
perpetrators O
Kaspersky O
called O
the O
Winnti B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
. O

APT10 B-HackOrg
is O
a O
threat O
actor O
that O
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O

2009 O
. O

APT10 B-HackOrg
has O
historically O

We O
believe O
APT10 B-HackOrg
is O
the O
most O
significant O
Chinese O

highlights O
the O

We O
believe O

O
the O

After O

it O

be O
exploited O

As O
observed O
previously O
with O
CVE-2017-11882 B-Exp
and O
CVE-2018-0802 B-Exp
, O
the O
weaponizer B-Tool
was O
used O
exclusively O
by O
Chinese O
cyber O
espionage O
actors B-HackOrg
for O
approximately O
one O
year O
December O
2017 O
through O
December O
2018 O
, O
after O
which O
cybercrime O
actors O
began O
to O
incorporate O
it O
in O
their O
malicious O

However O
, O
Beginning O
on O

June O
2019 O

O
we O
started O
observing O
multiple O

Mostly O
dropping O
AsyncRAT O
using O
the O
updated O

the O
same O

(CVE-2018-0798) O
. O

Analysis O
of O
the O
Royal O

has O
resulted O
in O
the O
discovery O
that O
multiple O
Chinese O
threat B-HackOrg
groups I-HackOrg
started O
utilizing O
CVE-2018-0798 B-Exp
in O
their O
RTF B-Tool
weaponizer I-Tool
. O

These O
findings O
also O
suggest O
that O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
groups I-HackOrg
have O
robust O
exploit O
developing O
capabilities O
because O
CVE-2018-0798 B-Exp

not O

reflects O
a O
very O
strong O

These O
APT B-HackOrg

will O
exist O
for O
a O
long O
time O

The O

the O
final O
payload O
of O

was O
still O
active O
during O
the O
time O
of O

hence O
we O
were O
able O
to O
download O
a O

we O
found O
multiple O

O
it O

The O

Cisco O

recently O
published O
a O

describing O

in O
the O
Middle O
East O
region O
which O
we O
believe O
may O
be O
connected O
. O

Operation B-HackOrg
Parliament I-HackOrg
appears O
to O
be O
another O
symptom O
of O
escalating O
tensions O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
region O
. O

The O
attackers B-HackOrg
have O
taken O
great O
care O
to O
stay O
under O
the O
radar O
, O
imitating O
another O
attack O
group O
in O
the O
region O
. O

With O
deception O
and O
false O
flags O
increasingly O
being O
employed O
by O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
, O
attribution O
is O
a O
hard O
and O
complicated O
task O
that O
requires O
solid O
evidence O
, O
especially O
in O
complex O
regions O
such O
as O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

The O
malware O
was O
first O
seen O
packed O
with O
VMProtect; O
when O
unpacked O
the O
sample O
didn’t O
show O
any O
similarities O
with O
previously O
known O
malware O
. O

The O
malware O
starts O
communicating O
with O
the O
C&C O
server O
by O
sending O
basic O
information O
about O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

The O
malware O
basically O
provides O
a O
remote O
CMD/PowerShell B-Tool
terminal O
for O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
, O
enabling O
them O
to O
execute O
scripts/commands O
and O
receive O
the O
results O
via O
HTTP O
requests O
. O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O
facade O
was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
attacks O
designed O
to O
steal O
credentials O
and O
spy O
on O
the O
activity O
of O
dozens O
of O
journalists O
, O
human O
rights O
defenders O
, O
trade O
unions O
and O
labour O
rights O
activists O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
are O
seemingly O
involved O
in O
the O
issue O
of O
migrants’ O
rights O
in O
Qatar O
and O
Nepal O
. O

We O
refer O
to O
this O
campaign O
and O
the O
associated O

as O
Operation B-HackOrg
Kingphish I-HackOrg
Malik” O
, O
in O
one O
of O
its O
written O
forms O
in O
Arabic O
, O
translates O
to O
King” O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
December O
2016 O
, O
O
Amnesty O
International O
published O
an O
investigation O
into O
another O
social O
engineering O
campaign O
perpetrated O
by O
a O
seemingly O
fake O
human O
rights O
organization O
known O
as O
Voiceless B-HackOrg
Victims O
, O
which O
targeted O
international O
human O
rights O
and O
labour O
rights O
organizations O
campaigning O
on O
migrant O
workers’ O
rights O
in O
Qatar O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
may O
have O
impersonated O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
real O
young O
woman O
and O
stole O
her O
pictures O
to O
construct O
the O
fake O
profile O
, O
along O
with O
a O
professional O
biography O
also O
stolen O
from O
yet O
another O
person O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
this O
email O
correspondence O
, O
the O
attacker B-HackOrg
— O
Safeena” O
— O
then O
sent O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
invitations O
to O
access O
several O
documents O
on O
Google O
Drive O
. O

The O
attackers B-HackOrg
were O
meticulous O
in O
making O
their O
phishing O
page O
as O
credible O
as O
possible O
. O

Among O
the O
targets O
of O
this O
campaign O
is O
the O
International O
Trade O
Union O
Confederation O
(ITUC) O
. O

Both O
in O
the O
attacks O
against O
ITUC O
and O
in O
other O
occasions O
, O
Operation B-HackOrg
Kingphish I-HackOrg
approached O
selected O
targets O
over O
social B-Tool

, O
prominently B-Tool
Facebook I-Tool
, O
and O
engaged O
in O

conversations O
with O
them O
on O

off O
, O
sometimes O
over O
a O
period O
of O
several O
months O
. O

This O
time O
the O
document O
purported O
to O
be O
about O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
Emir O
of O
Qatar O
in O
funding O
ISIS O
, O
which O
was O
seemingly O
copied O
from O
a O
website O
critical O
of O
Qatar O
. O

While O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
underlying O
Qatar O
migrant O
workers O
theme O
in O
Operation B-HackOrg
Sheep I-HackOrg
, O
it O
is O
also O
hypothetically O
possible O
that O
these O
attacks O
could O
have O
been O
perpetrated O
by O
a O
malicious O
actor O
affiliated O
to O
a O
different O
government O
with O
an O
interest O
in O
damaging O
the O

This O

that O
we’ve O

Operation B-HackOrg
Pawn I-HackOrg
Storm I-HackOrg
is O
an O
active O
economic O
and O
political O
cyber-espionage O
operation O
that O
targets O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
entities O
, O
like O
the O
military O
, O
governments O
, O
defense O
industries O
, O
and O
the O
media O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
iOS O
malware O
gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
next O
stage O
SEDNIT O
malware O
we O
have O
found O
for O
Microsoft O
Windows’ O
systems O
. O

We O
found O
two O
malicious O
iOS O
applications O
in O
Operation O
Pawn O
Storm O
. O

One O
is O
called O
XAgent O
detected O
as O
IOS_XAGENT.A O
and O
the O
other O
one O
uses O
the O
name O
of O
a O
legitimate O
iOS O
game O
, O
MadCap O
detected O
as O
IOS_ O
XAGENT.B O
. O

The O
obvious O
goal O
of O
the O
SEDNIT-related B-HackOrg
spyware O
is O
to O
steal O
personal O

, O
record O
audio O
, O
make O
screenshots O
, O
and O
send O
them O
to O
a O
remote O
command-and-control O
(C&C) O

. O

Madcap” O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
XAgent O
malware O
, O
but O
the O
former O
is O
focused O
on O
recording O
audio O
. O

from O
an O

The O
dropper O
first O
appeared O
in O
mid-July O
, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
APT O
activity O
is O
potentially O
ongoing O
, O
with O
Turla B-HackOrg
actively O
targeting O
G20 O
participants O
and/or O
those O
with O
interest O
in O
the O
G20 O
, O
including O
member O
nations O
, O
journalists O
, O
and O
policymakers O
. O

Turla B-HackOrg
is O
a O
well-documented O
, O
long O
operating O
APT O
group O
that O
is O
widely O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
Russian O
state-sponsored O
organization O
. O

Turla B-HackOrg
is O
perhaps O
most O
notoriously O
suspected O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
United O
States O
Central O
Command O
in O
2008 O
. O

More O
recently O
Turla B-HackOrg
was O
accused O
of O
breaching O
RUAG O
, O
a O
Swiss O
technology O
company O
, O
in O
a O
public O
report O
published O
by O
GovCERT.ch O
. O

The O
delivery O
of O
KopiLuwak O
in O
this O
instance O
is O
currently O
unknown O
as O
the O
MSIL O
dropper O
has O
only O
been O
observed O
by O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
on O
a O
public O
malware O
repository O
. O

Assuming O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
ways O
it O
may O
have O
been O
delivered O
including O
some O
of O
Turla’s B-HackOrg
previous O
attack O
methods O
such O
as O
spear O
phishing O
or O
via O
a O
watering O
hole O
. O

This O
could O
include O
diplomats O
, O
experts O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital O
Economy O
Task O
Force O
, O
or O
possibly O

. O

Turla's B-HackOrg
goal O
could O
include O
diplomats O
, O
experts O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital O
Economy O
Task O
Force O
, O
or O
possibly O
even O
journalists O
. O

The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak O
of O
which O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL O
dropper O
. O

The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL O
dropper O
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF O
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript O
(JS) O
dropper O
. O

As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS O
dropper O
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS O
decryptor O
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak O
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

As O
Proofpoint O
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL O
payload O
. O

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak O
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating O
files O
to O
the O
C&C O
as O
well O
as O
downloading O
files O
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

Despite O
the O
added O
capabilities O
, O
we O
still O
agree O
with O
Kaspersky O
that O
this O
backdoor O
is O
likely O
used O
as O
an O
initial O
reconnaissance O
tool O
and O
would O
probably O
be O
used O
as O
a O
staging O
point O
to O
deploy O
one O
of O
Turla’s B-HackOrg
more O
fully O
featured O
implants O
. O

Turla B-HackOrg
is O
a O
complex O
cyberattack O
platform O
focused O
predominantly O
on O
diplomatic O
and O
government-related O
targets O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
Central O
and O
Far O
East O
Asia O
, O
Europe O
, O
North O
and O
South O
America O
and O
former O
Soviet O
bloc O
nations O
. O

We O
didn’t O
choose O
to O
name O
it O
after O
a O
vegetable; O
the O
.NET O
malware O
developers O
named O
it O
Topinambour O
themselves O
. O

The O
role O
of O
the O
.NET O
module O
is O
to O
deliver O
the O
known O
KopiLuwak O
JavaScript O
Trojan O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Turla B-HackOrg
now O
also O
has O
a O
heavily O
obfuscated O
PowerShell O
Trojan O
that O
is O
similar O
to O
KopiLuwak O
. O

RocketMan!” O
(probably O
a O
reference O
to O
Donald O
Trump’s O
nickname O
for O
Kim O
Jong O

and O
MiamiBeach” O
serve O
as O
the O
first O
beacon O
messages O
from O
the O
victim O
to O
the O
control O
server O
. O

These O
could O
be O
tools O
to O
circumvent O
internet O
censorship O
, O
such O
as O
Softether O
VPN O
4.12” O
and O
psiphon3” O

or O
Microsoft O
Office O
activators” O
. O

These O
campaign-related O
VPSs B-HackOrg
are O
located O
in O
South O
Africa O
. O

The O
tool O
does O
all O
that O
a O
typical O
Trojan O
needs O
to O
accomplish: O
upload O
, O
download O
and O
execute O
files O
, O
fingerprint O
target O
systems O
. O

The O
PowerShell O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan O
also O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
get O
screenshots O
. O

The O
Trojan O
is O
quite O
similar O
to O
the O
.NET O
RocketMan O
Trojan O
and O
can O
handle O
the O
same O
commands; O
additionally O
, O
it O
includes O
the O
#screen” O
command O
to O
take O
a O
screenshot O
. O

The O
usage O
of O
KopiLuwak B-Tool
, O
a O
well-known O
and O
exclusive O
artefact O
previously O
used O
by O
the O
Turla B-HackOrg
group O
, O
makes O
us O
attribute O
this O
campaign O
to O
this O
actor O
with O
high O
confidence O
. O

Winnti's B-HackOrg

Hackers B-HackOrg
usually O
take O
precautions O
, O
which O

as O
Opsec O
. O

The O
Winnti B-HackOrg
group’s O
Opsec O
was O
dismal O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

This O
mode O
of O
operation O
is O
typical O
of O
many O
hacker B-HackOrg
groups—and O
especially O
of O
Winnti B-HackOrg
. O

They O
are O
a O
very O
, O
very O
persistent O
group O
, O
” O
says O
Costin O
Raiu O
, O
who O
has O
been O
watching O
Winnti B-HackOrg
since O
2011 O
. O

Raiu O
and O
his O
team O
have O
followed O
the O
digital O
tracks O
left O
behind O
by O
some O
of O
the O
Winnti B-HackOrg
hackers O
. O

One O
government O
official O
puts O
it O
very O
matter-of-factly: O
Winnti B-HackOrg
is O
very O
specific O
to O
Germany O
. O

By O
2014 O
, O
the O
Winnti B-HackOrg
malware O
code O
was O
no O
longer O
limited O
to O
game O
manufacturers O
. O

Winnti B-HackOrg
is O
targeting O
high-tech O
companies O
as O
well O
as O
chemical O
and O
pharmaceutical O
companies O
. O

Winnti B-HackOrg
is O
attacking O
companies O
in O
Japan O
, O
France O
, O
O
the O
U.S. O
and O
Germany O
. O

The O
Winnti B-HackOrg
hackers O
broke O
into O
Henkel’s O
network O
in O
2014 O
. O

Henkel O
confirms O
the O
Winnti B-HackOrg
incident O
and O
issues O
the O
following O
statement: O
The O
cyberattack O
was O
discovered O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
and O
Henkel O
promptly O
took O
all O
necessary O
precautions O
. O

Far O
from O
attacking O
Henkel O
and O
the O
other O
companies O
arbitrarily O
, O
Winnti B-HackOrg
takes O
a O
highly O
strategic O
approach O
. O

The O
hackers B-HackOrg
behind O
Winnti O
have O
also O
set O
their O
sights O
on O
Japan’s O
biggest O
chemical O
company O
, O
Shin-Etsu O
Chemical O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
another O
Japanese O
company O
, O
Sumitomo O
Electric O
, O
Winnti B-HackOrg
apparently O
penetrated O
their O
networks O
during O
the O
summer O
of O
2016 O
. O

Winnti B-HackOrg
hackers O
also O
penetrated O
the O
BASF O
and O
Siemens O
networks O
. O

Thanks O
to O
this O
tool O
, O
we O
found O
out O
back O
in O
March O
2019 O
that O
the O
Bayer O
pharmaceutical O
group O
had O
been O
hacked O
by O
Winnti B-HackOrg
. O

At O
Gameforge O
, O
the O
Winnti B-HackOrg
hackers O
had O
already O
been O
removed O
from O
the O
networks O
when O
a O
staff O
member O
noticed O
a O
Windows O
start O
screen O
with O
Chinese O
characters O
. O

To O
witnesses O
, O
the O
spy B-HackOrg
appears O
to O
be O
running O
a O
program O
showing O
videos O
(e.g O
VLC) O
, O
presenting B-Tool
slides I-Tool
(Prezi) O
, O
playing O
a O
computer O
game O
(Breakout2 O
, O
O
2048) O
or O
even O
running O
a O
fake B-Tool
virus I-Tool
scanner I-Tool
. O

From O
the O
time O
of O
file O
creation O
, O
the O
attacker B-HackOrg
started O
working O
at O
least O
as O
early O
as O
July O
2018 O
. O

The O

was O
also O
mentioned O
by O
Kaspersky’s O

, O
which O
confirms O
that O
the O
APT-C-09 B-HackOrg
group O
keeps O
updating O
its O
C2 O
configuration O

APT41 B-HackOrg
is O
unique O
among O

China-based O
actors O
in O
that O
it O
leverages O
non-public O

in O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
activity O
that O

Based O
on O

consistent O
behavior O

and O
APT41's B-HackOrg
unusual O
focus O
on O
the O

are O
most O
likely O
motivated O
by O

Activity O
traces O
back O
to O
2012 O
when O

We O
believe O
that O
like O

, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O

away O
from O

APT41 B-HackOrg
was O
observed O
carrying O

APT41's B-HackOrg
activities O
have O
included O
a O

In O
2018 O

we O
observed O
APT41 B-HackOrg
target O
a O
third O
healthcare O

, O
although O
their O
goals O
during O
this O
compromise O
were O
unclear O
. O

In O
June O
2018 O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
sent O
spear-phishing O
emails O
using O
an O
invitation O
lure O
to O
join O
a O
decentralized O
gaming O
platform O
linked O
to O
a O

that O
had O
positioned O
itself O
as O

This O
provides O
another O
connection O
between O
the O
targeting O

In O
October O
2018 O
, O
the O
group B-HackOrg
compiled O
an O
instance O
of O
XMRig B-Tool
, O
a O
Monero O
cryptocurrency O
mining O
tool O
, O
demonstrating O
a O
continued O
interest O
in O
cryptocurrency O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
campaigns O
focused O
on O
the O
video O
game O
sector O
have O
largely O
affected O
studios O
and O
distributors O
in O
East O
and O
Southeast O
Asia O
, O
although O
global O
companies O
based O
in O
the O
United O
States O
have O
also O
been O
targeted O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
continuously O
returns O
to O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
sector O
and O
seems O
to O
have O
matured O
its O
campaigns O
through O
lessons O
learned O
in O
operations O
against O
the O
industry O
. O

We O
believe O
these O
operations O
include O
broadly O
malicious O
activity O
that O
can O
enable O
further O
operations O
, O
such O
as O
targeting O
game B-Tool
source I-Tool
code I-Tool
and O
compromising O
digital B-Tool
certificates I-Tool
, O
while O
other O
activities O
are O
explicitly O
financially O
motivated O
, O
such O
as O
abusing O
in-game O
currency O
mechanics O
. O

In O
October O
2012 O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
used O
captured O
credentials O
to O
compromise O
a O
jump O
server O
and O
access O
a O
production O
environment O
where O
they O
deployed O
a O
Linux O
version O
of O
PHOTO O
. O

Since O
at O
least O
2012 O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
repeatedly O
gained O
access O
to O
game O
development O
environments O
within O
affected O
companies O
, O
including O
online O
multiplayer O
networks O
, O
as O
well O
as O
targeting O
of O
production O
database O
administrators O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
been O
observed O
inserting O
malicious O
code O
into O
legitimate O
video O
game O
files O
to O
distribute O
malware O
. O

In O
2018 O
, O
the O
group B-HackOrg
inserted O
CRACKSHOT O
malware O
into O
game O
files O
that O
were O
signed O
with O
legitimate O
codesigning O
certificates O
, O
most O
likely O
indicating O
access O
to O
the O
production O
environment O
, O
which O
facilitated O
a O
supply O
chain O
compromise O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT41 B-HackOrg
limitedly O
deploy O
rootkits O
on O
Linux O
systems O
and O
Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
, O
such O
as O
ROCKBOOT B-Tool
, O
on O
Windows O
systems O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
victim O
systems O
. O

Selective O
deployment O
of O
ROCKBOOT O
suggests O
that O
APT41 B-HackOrg
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
blatantly O
engaged O
in O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
, O
including O
manipulating O
virtual O
currencies O
. O

In O
a O
highly O
unusual O
case O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
attempted O
to O
extort O
a O
game O
company O
by O
deploying O
the O
Encryptor O
RaaS O
ransomware O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
is O
well-known O
for O
leveraging O
compromised O
digital O
certificates O
from O
video O
game O
studios O
to O
sign O
malware O
. O

We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 B-HackOrg
sought O
to O
target O
in-game O
currency O
but O
found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
the O
specific O
targeted O
game O
, O
so O
the O
group O
resorted O
to O
ransomware O
to O
attempt O
to O
salvage O
their O
efforts O
and O
profit O
from O
the O
compromise O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
also O
used O
credentials O
compromised O
in O
previous O
operations O
. O

In O
2014 O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
compromised O
an O
online O
billing/payment O
service O
using O
VPN O
access O
between O
a O
third-party O
service O
provider O
and O
the O
targeted O
payment O
service O
. O

Although O
we O
do O
not O
have O
first-hand O
evidence O
of O
APT41's O
compromise O
of O
TeamViewer B-Tool
, O
we O
have O
observed O
APT41 B-HackOrg
use O
compromised O

as O
an O

As O
demonstrated O
in O
operations O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O

, O
O
APT41 B-HackOrg
leverages O
a O
variety B-Tool
of I-Tool
TTPs I-Tool
to O
access O
production O
environments O
where O
they O
can O
inject O
malicious O

. O

In O
March O
2017 O
, O
suspected O
Chinese B-HackOrg

unusual O
among O

APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
conducted O
simultaneous O
cyber O

. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
operations O
against O
higher O

provide O
some O
indication O
that O
the O

For O
example O
, O
the O
group B-HackOrg
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O

The O
group’s O
financially O

on O
the O
video O

, O
where O
APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
manipulated O
virtual O

and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy O

In O
another O
instance O
, O
O
APT41 B-HackOrg
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O
reservation O

the O
large O
number O

normal O
day O
jobs O
. O

The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
group’s O
later O
espionage O
operations O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O
malware B-Tool
families I-Tool
and O
tools B-Tool
to O
accomplish O
their O
missions O
, O
O
including O
publicly O
available O
utilities O
, O
malware O
shared O
with O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operations O
, O
and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O
group B-HackOrg
. O

Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
can O
leverage O
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs O
and O
deploy O
additional O
malware O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing O
emails O
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML O
(.chm) O
files O
to O
initially O
compromise O
their O
victims O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
also O
deployed O
rootkits O
and O
Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
select O
victim O
systems O
. O

The O
limited O
use O
of O
these O
tools O
by O
APT41 B-HackOrg
suggests O
the O
group O
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

Like O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operators O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
appears O
to O
have O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O
access O
and O
away O
from O
direct O
intellectual O
property O
theft O
since O
2015 O
. O

This O
shift O
, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
affected O
the O
group's B-HackOrg
consistent O
interest O
in O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
for O
financially O
motivated O
reasons O
. O

BalkanRAT O
enables O
the O
attacker O
to O
remotely O
control O
the O
compromised O
computer O
via O
a O
graphical O
interface O
, O
i.e O
, O
manually; O
BalkanDoor O
enables O
them O
to O
remotely O
control O
the O
compromised O
computer O
via O
a O
command O
line O
, O
i.e O
, O
possibly O
en O

. O

With O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
emails O
, O
included O
links O
and O
decoy O
PDFs O
all O
involving O
taxes O
, O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
are O
apparently O
targeting O
the O
financial O
departments O
of O
organizations O
in O
the O
Balkans O
region O
. O

Some O
parts O
of O
the O
campaign O
were O
briefly O
described O
by O
a O
Serbian O
security O
provider O
in O
2016 O
and O
the O
Croatian O
CERT O
in O
2017 O
. O

The O
campaign O
has O
been O
active O
at O
least O
from O
January O
2016 O
to O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
the O
most O
recent O
detections O
in O
our O
telemetry O
are O
from O
July O
2019 O
. O

Our O
findings O
show O
that O
the O
mentioned O
attacks B-HackOrg
have O
been O
orchestrated O
and O
we O
consider O
them O
a O
single O
long-term O
campaign O
that O
spans O
Croatia O
, O
Serbia O
, O
Montenegro O
, O
and O
Bosnia O
and O
Herzegovina O
. O

We’ve O
discovered O
a O
new O
version O
of O
BalkanDoor B-HackOrg
with O
a O
new O
method O
for O
execution/installation: O
an O
exploit O
of O
the O
WinRAR O
ACE O
vulnerability O
CVE-2018-20250 B-Exp
. O

Both O
BalkanRAT O
and O
BalkanDoor O
spread O
in O
Croatia O
, O
Serbia O
, O
Montenegro O
, O
and O
Bosnia O
and O
Herzegovina O
. O

According O
to O
our O
telemetry O
, O
the O
campaign O
spreading O
these O
tools O
has O
been O
live O
since O
2016 O
, O
with O
the O
most O
recent O
detections O
as O
late O
as O
in O
July O
2019 O
. O

In O
some O
of O
the O
latest O
samples O
of O
BalkanDoor O
detected O
in O
2019 O
, O
the O
malware O
is O
distributed O
as O
an O
ACE O
archive O
, O
O
disguised O
as O
a O
RAR O
archive O
(i.e O
, O
not O
an O
executable O
file) O
, O
specially O
crafted O
to O
exploit O
the O
WinRAR O
ACE O
vulnerability O
CVE-2018-20250 B-Exp
. O

Via O
the O
BalkanDoor O
backdoor O
, O
O
the O
attacker B-HackOrg
sends O
a O
backdoor O
command O
to O
unlock O
the O
screen… O
and O
using O
BalkanRAT B-Tool
, O
they O
can O
do O
whatever O
they O
want O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
BalkanDoor B-Tool
backdoor B-Tool
does O
not O
implement O
any O
exfiltration O
channel O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
leveraged O
ADORE.XSEC B-Tool
, O
a O
Linux O
backdoor O
launched O
by O
the O
Adore-NG O
rootkit O
, O
throughout O
an O
organization's O
Linux O
environment O
. O

The O
backdoor O
can O
connect O
to O
any O
of O
the O
C&Cs O
from O
a O
hardcoded O
list O
– O
a O
measure O
to O
increase O
resilience O
. O

The O
main O
part O
of O
the O
BalkanRAT O
malware O
is O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
Remote O
Utilities O
software O
for O
remote O
access O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
some O
of O
the O
APT41's B-HackOrg
POISONPLUG B-Tool

samples O
leverage O
the O
Steam O
Community O
website O
associated O
with O
Valve O
, O
a O
video O
game O
developer O
and O
publisher O
. O

The O
campaign O
targeting O
accountants O
in O
the O
Balkans O
shows O
some O
similarities O
with O
a O
campaign O
aimed O
at O
Ukrainian O
notaries O
reported O
in O
2016 O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
Let’s O
Encrypt O
certificate O
issuance O
date O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign O
to O
be O
active O
from O
May O
2019 O
. O

One O
of O
the O
domains O
uncovered O
during O
the O
investigation O
was O
identified O
by O
the O
Chinese O
security O
vendor O
CERT O
360 O
as O
being O
part O
of O
the O
BITTER B-HackOrg
APT I-HackOrg
campaign O
in O
May O
2019 O
. O

Further O
analysis O
of O
the O
BITTER B-HackOrg
APT’s I-HackOrg
infrastructure O
uncovered O
a O
broader O
phishing O
campaign O
targeting O
other O
government O
sites O
and O
state-owned O
enterprises O
in O
China O
. O

Further O
investigation O
revealed O
approximately O
40 O
additional O
sites O
, O
all O
of O
which O
appear O
to O
be O
targeting O
the O
government O
of O
China O
and O
other O
organisations O
in O
China O
. O

We O
expect O
to O
see O
BITTER B-HackOrg
APT I-HackOrg
continuing O
to O
target O
the O
government O
of O
China O
by O
employing O
spoofed O
login O
pages O
designed O
to O
steal O
user O

and O
obtain O
access O
to O

, O
O
based O
on O

from O
360-CERT O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
analysis O
, O
the O

however O
, O
O
based O
on O
BITTER B-HackOrg
APT I-HackOrg

, O
O
it O
is O
highly O

that O

, O
is O
sold O
on O
the O
dark O

by O
an O
underground O

ITG08 B-HackOrg
is O
an O
organized O
cybercrime O
gang O
that O
has O
been O
active O
since O
2015 O
, O
mostly O
targeting O
pointof-sale O

in O
brick-and-mortar O
retailers O
and O
companies O
in O
the O
hospitality O
sector O
in O

. O

Past O
campaigns O
by O
ITG08 B-HackOrg
using O
the O
More_eggs B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
were O
last O
reported O
in O
February O
2019 O
. O

Attackers B-HackOrg
use O
it O
to O
create O
, O
expand O
and O
cement O
their O
foothold O
in O
compromised O
environments O
. O

Lastly O
, O
ITG08 B-HackOrg
used O
Comodo B-Tool
code-signing I-Tool
certificates I-Tool
several O
times O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
campaign O
. O

Let’s O
take O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
ITG08’s B-HackOrg
TTPs O
that O
are O
relevant O
to O
the O
campaign O
we O
investigated O
, O
starting O
with O
its O
spear O
phishing O
and O
intrusion O
tactics O
and O
covering O
information O
on O
its O
use O
of O
the O
More_eggs O

. O

Additional O
capabilities O
of O
the O
More_eggs O
malware O
include O
the O
download O
and O
execution O
of O
files O
and O
scripts O
and O
running O
commands O
using O
cmd.exe O
. O

X-Force O
IRIS O
determined O
that O
the O
More_eggs O

O
as O
described O
below O
, O
to O
create O
a O
reverse O

a O
remote O
host O
. O

Once O
the O
ITG08 B-HackOrg
established O
a O
foothold O
on O
the O
network O
, O
they O
employed O
WMI B-Tool
and O
PowerShell B-Tool
techniques O
to O
perform O
network O
reconnaissance O
and O
move O
laterally O
within O
the O
environment O
. O

The O
attackers B-HackOrg
used O
this O
technique O
to O
remotely O
install O
a O

Stylistically O

dismiss O
the O

that O
the O

In O

As O
of O
June O

In O
some O

Machete B-HackOrg
trick O

by O
sending O
real O

that O

. O

Machete B-HackOrg
relies O
on O
spearphishing O
to O
compromise O
its O

. O

They B-HackOrg
seem O
to O
have O
specialized O
knowledge O
about O

as O
they O
are O
focused O
on O
stealing O
specific O

such O
as O
those O
that O

Attackers B-HackOrg
take O
advantage O
of O
that O
, O
along O
with O
their O
knowledge O
of O
military O
jargon O
and O
etiquette O
, O
to O
craft O
very O
convincing O
phishing O
emails O
. O

Operators O
behind O
Machete B-HackOrg
apparently O
already O
have O
information O
about O

how O

as O
subsequent O
spear-phishing O
campaigns O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
reported O
from O
March O
until O
May O
2018 O
. O

Bitdefender’s B-HackOrg
forensics O
and O
investigation O
team O
was O
contacted O
to O
look O
into O
a O
security O
incident O
that O
started O
in O
May O
2018 O
with O
an O
email O
received O
by O
two O
of O
the O
bank’s O
employees O
. O

The O
Carbanak B-HackOrg
group O
, O
which O
has O
a O
long O
track O
record O
of O
compromising O
infrastructure O
belonging O
to O
financial O
institutions O
, O
is O
still O
active O
. O

Its B-HackOrg
purpose O
remains O
to O
manipulate O
financial O
assets O
, O
such O
as O
transferring O
funds O
from O
bank O
accounts O
or O
taking O
over O
ATM O
infrastructures O
and O
instructing O
them O
to O
dispense O
cash O
at O
predetermined O
time O
intervals O
. O

If O
the O
attack O
had O
succeeded O
, O
it O
would O
have O
given O
hackers B-HackOrg
control O
over O
the O
ATM O
network O
, O
while O
money O
mules O
would O
have O
been O
standing O
by O
the O
ATM O
machines O
at O
pre-set O
time O
intervals O
to O
cash O
them O
out O
. O

The O
actors B-HackOrg
uploaded O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
that O
they O
used O
to O
perform O
additional O
activities O
on O
the O
compromised O
network O
, O
such O
as O
dumping B-Tool
credentials I-Tool
, O
as O
well O
as O
locating O
and O
pivoting O
to O
additional O
systems O
on O
the O
network O
. O

We O
believe O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
exploited O
a O
recently O
patched O
vulnerability B-Exp
in O
Microsoft O
SharePoint O
tracked O
by O
CVE-2019-0604 B-Exp
, O
which O
is O
a O
remote O
code O
execution O
vulnerability O
used O
to O
compromise O
the O
server O
and O
eventually O
install O
a O
webshell O
. O

Bitdefender’s B-HackOrg
investigation O
shows O
the O
attackers’ O
main O
methods O
remain O
to O
quietly O
infiltrate O
the O
infrastructure O
by O
establishing O
a O
foothold O
on O
an O
employee’s O
system O
, O
then O
move O
laterally O
across O
the O
infrastructure O
or O
elevate O
privileges O
to O
find O
critical O
systems O
that O
manage O
financial O
transactions O
or O
ATM O
networks O
. O

We O
also O
found O
the O
China B-Tool
Chopper I-Tool
webshell I-Tool
on O
the O
SharePoint O
servers O
, O
which O
has O
also O
been O
used O
by O
the O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
threat O
group O
. O

Of O
particular O
note O
is O
their O
use O
of O
tools O
to O
identify O
systems O
vulnerable O
to O
CVE-2017-0144 B-Exp
, O
which O
is O
the O
same O
vulnerability O
exploited O
by O
EternalBlue O
that O
is O
best O
known O
for O
its O
use O
in O
the O
WannaCry O
attacks O
of O
2017 O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
aforementioned O
post-exploitation O
tools O
, O
the O
actors O
used O
these O
webshells O
to O
upload O
legitimate O
executables O
that O
they O
would O
use O
DLL O
sideloading O
to O
run O
a O
malicious O
DLL O
that O
has O
code O
overlaps O
with O
known O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
attacks O
. O

This O
webshell O
activity O
took O
place O
across O
three O
SharePoint O
servers O
hosted O
by O
two O
different O
government O
organizations O
between O
April O
1 O
, O
2019 O
and O
April O
16 O
, O
2019 O
, O
where O
actors O
uploaded O
a O
total O
of O
24 O
unique O
executables O
across O
the O
three O
SharePoint O
servers O
. O

The O
timeline O
shows O
three O
main O
clusters O
of O
activity O
across O
the O
three O
webshells O
, O
with O
activity O
occurring O
on O
two O
separate O
webshells O
(green O
and O
orange) O
within O
a O
very O
small O
window O
of O
time O
on O
April O
2 O
, O
2019 O
and O
the O
activity O
involving O
the O
third O
webshell O
two O
weeks O
later O
on O
April O
16 O
, O
2019 O
. O

In O
April O
2019 O
, O
several O
national O
security O
organizations O
released O
alerts O
on O
CVE-2019-0604 B-Exp
exploitation O
, O
including O
the O
Saudi O
Arabian O
National O
Cyber O
Security O
Center O
and O
the O
Canadian O
Center O
for O
Cyber O
Security O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
functionality O
of O
the O
various O
tools O
uploaded O
to O
the O
webshells O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
threat B-HackOrg
actors I-HackOrg
breach O
the O
SharePoint O
servers O
to O
use O
as O
a O
beachhead O
, O
then O
attempt O
to O
move O
laterally O
across O
the O
network O
via O
stolen O
credentials O
and O
exploiting O
vulnerabilities O
. O

We O
also O
observed O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
uploading O
custom O
backdoors O
such O
as O
HyperBro B-Tool
which O
is O
commonly O
associated O
with O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
. O

Both O
of O
these O
alerts O
discussed O
campaigns O
in O
which O
actors B-HackOrg
used O
the O
CVE-2019-0604 B-Exp
to O
exploit O
SharePoint O
servers O
to O
install O
the O
China B-Tool
Chopper I-Tool
webshell I-Tool
. O

During O
our O
research O
into O
this O
attack O
campaign O
, O
Unit O
42 O
gathered O
several O
tools O
that O
the O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
uploaded O
to O
the O
three O
webshells O
at O
the O
two O
government O
organizations O
. O

We O
also O
observed O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
uploading O
the O
HyperBro B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
to O
one O
of O
the O
webshells O
, O
as O
well O
as O
legitimate O
executables O
that O
would O
sideload O
malicious O
DLLs O
that O
have O
overlapping O
code O
associated O
with O
known O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
activity O
. O

Lastly O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
uploading O
a O
custom O
backdoor O
called O
HyperBro B-Tool
, O
which O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
operations O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
other O
overlapping O
files O
are O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
adversary O
to O
locate O
other O
systems O
on O
the O
network O
(etool.exe) O
, O
check O
to O
see O
if O
they O
are O
vulnerable O
to O
CVE-2017-0144 B-Exp
(EternalBlue) O
patched O
in O
MS07-010 O
(checker1.exe) O
and O
pivot O
to O
them O
using O
remote O
execution O
functionality O
offered O
by O
a O
tool O
similar O
to O
PsExec O
offered O
by O
Impacket O
(psexec.exe) O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
NCSC O
advisory O
mentioned O
that O
the O
actors O
used O
a O
file O
name O
stylecss.aspx O
for O
their O
webshell O
, O
which O
is O
the O
same O
filename O
we O
saw O
associated O
with O
China O
Chopper O
. O

We O
will O
provide O
an O
analysis O
of O
the O
HyperBro O
tool O
in O
an O
upcoming O
section O
. O

However O
, O
using O
NCC O
Group’s O
research O
published O
in O
May O
2018 O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
discover O
code O
overlaps O
between O
these O
DLLs O
and O
a O
sideloaded O
DLL O
that O
ran O
the O
SysUpdate O
tool O
that O
the O
NCC O
group O
has O
associated O
with O
an O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
campaign O
. O

The O
list O
also O
includes O
several O
hack B-Tool
tools I-Tool
, O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Tool
for O
credential O
dumping O
and O
several O
compiled O
python B-Tool
scripts I-Tool
used O
to O
locate O
and O
compromise O
other O
systems O
on O
the O
local O
network O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
O
we O
do O
not O
have O
access O
to O
the O
PYTHON33.hlp O
or O
CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp O
files O
, O
so O
we O
do O
not O
know O
the O
final O
payload O
loaded O
by O
either O
of O
these O
DLLs O
. O

Figure O
9 O
shows O
a O
code O
comparison O
between O
the O
PYTHON33.dll O
(right) O
and O
inicore_v2.3.30.dll O

(SHA256: O
4d65d371a789aabe1beadcc10b38da1f998cd3ec87d4cc1cfbf0af014b783822) O
, O
which O
was O
sideloaded O
to O
run O
the O
SysUpdate B-Tool
tool O
in O
a O
previous O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
campaign O
. O

The O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
threat O
group O
loaded O
the O
China B-Tool
Chopper I-Tool
webshell O
onto O
SharePoint O
servers O
at O
two O
Government O
organizations O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
with O
high O
confidence O
involved O
exploiting O
a O
remote O
code O
execution O
vulnerability O
in O
SharePoint O
tracked O
in O
CVE-2019-0604 B-Exp
. O

The O
files O
uploaded O
to O
this O
webshell O
included O
the O
same O
compiled O
python B-Tool
script I-Tool
that O
would O
scan O
remote O
systems O
that O
were O
vulnerable O
to O
CVE-2017-0144 B-Exp
(EternalBlue) O
that O
we O
saw O
uploaded O
to O
the O
other O
errr.aspx O
webshell O
. O

According O
to O
Microsoft’s O
advisory O
, O
this O
vulnerability O
was O
patched O
on O
March O
12 O
, O
2019 O
and O
we O
first O
saw O
the O
webshell O
activity O
on O
April O
1 O
, O
2019 O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
pivoted O
to O
other O
systems O
on O
the O
network O
using O
stolen O
credentials O
and O
by O
exploiting O
the O
CVE-2017-0144 B-Exp
(EternalBlue) O
vulnerability O
patched O
in O
MS17-010 O
. O

Once O
the O
adversary O
established O
a O
foothold O
on O
the O
targeted O
network O
, O
they B-HackOrg
used O
China B-Tool
Chopper I-Tool
and O
other O
webshells O
to O
upload O
additional O
tools O
to O
the O
SharePoint O
server O
to O
dump O
credentials O
, O
perform O
network O
reconnaissance O
and O
pivot O
to O
other O
systems O
. O

We O
also O
observed O
Emissary B-HackOrg
Panda I-HackOrg
uploading O
legitimate O
tools O
that O
would O
sideload O
DLLs O
, O
specifically O
the O
Sublime O
Text O
plugin O
host O
and O
the O
Microsoft’s O
Create O
Media O
application O
, O
both O
of O
which O
we O
had O
never O
seen O
used O
for O
DLL O
sideloading O
before O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
Linux O
malware O
ecosystem O
is O
plagued O
by O
financial O
driven O
crypto-miners O
and O
DDoS O
botnet O
tools O
which O
mostly O
target O
vulnerable O
servers O
. O

We O
also O
observed O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
uploading O
legitimate O

that O
would O
sideload O

, O
specifically O
the O
Sublime B-Tool

application I-Tool
, O
both O
of O
which O
we O
had O
never O

used O
for O
DLL O
sideloading O
before O
. O

It B-HackOrg
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O
least O
2013 O
, O
and O
has O
targeted O
individuals O
likely O
involved O
with O
the O
Ukrainian O
government O
. O

The O
group’s B-HackOrg
implants O
are O
characterized O
by O
the O
employment O
of O
information O
stealing B-Tool
tools I-Tool
among O
them O
being O
screenshot O

stealers I-Tool
delivered O
via O
a O
SFX O
, O
and O
made O
to O
achieve O
persistence O
through O
a O

. O

The O
finding O
shows O
that O
EvilGnome B-Tool
operates O
on O
an O
IP O

that O
was O
controlled O
by O
the O
Gamaredon B-HackOrg

. O

FIN7 B-HackOrg
operations O
are O
linked O
to O
numerous O
intrusion O
attempts O
having O
targeted O
hundreds O
of O
companies O
since O
at O
least O
as O
early O
as O
2015 O
. O

The O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
intrusion O
set O
continued O
its O
tailored O
spear O
phishing O
campaigns O
throughout O
last O
year O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
during O
the O
investigation O
, O
we O
discovered O
certain O
similarities O
to O
other O
attacker B-HackOrg
groups I-HackOrg
that O
seemed O
to O
share O
or O
copy O
the O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
TTPs O
in O
their O
own O
operations O
. O

In O
2018-2019 O
, O
researchers O
of O
Kaspersky O
Lab’s O
Global O
Research O
and O
Analysis O
Team O
analyzed O
various O

that O
used O
the O
same O
Tactics O
Tools O
and O
Procedures O
(TTPs) O
as O
the O
historic O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
, O
leading O
the O
researchers O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
had O
remained O
active O
despite O
the O
2018 O
arrests O
. O

One O
of O
the O
domains O
used O
by O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
in O
their O
2018 O
campaign O
of O
spear O
phishing O
contained O
more O
than O
130 O
email O
HackOrges O
, O
leading O
us O
to O
think O
that O
more O
than O
130 O
companies O
had O
been O
targeted O
by O
the O
end O
of O
2018 O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
following O
some O
open-source O
publications O
about O
them O
, O
the O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
operators O
seems O
to O
have O
developed O
a O
homemade O
builder O
of O
malicious B-Tool
Office I-Tool
document I-Tool
using O
ideas O
from O
ThreadKit O
, O
which O
they O
employed O
during O
the O
summer O
of O
2018 O
. O

The O
first O
module O
downloaded O
by O
the O
GRIFFON O
malware O
to O
the O
victim’s O
computer O
is O
an O
information-gathering O
JScript O
, O
which O
allows O
the O
cybercriminals O
to O
understand O
the O
context O
of O
the O
infected O
workstation O
. O

The O
new O
GRIFFON O
implant O
is O
written O
to O
the O
hard O
drive O
before O
each O
execution O
, O
limiting O
the O
file-less” O
aspect O
of O
this O
method O
. O

Given O
FIN7’s B-HackOrg
previous O
use O
of O
false O
security O
companies O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
look O
deeper O
into O
this O
one O
. O

This O
activity B-HackOrg
cluster I-HackOrg
, O
which O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
has O
followed O
for O
a O
few O
years O
, O
uses O
various O

for O
targeting O
mainly O
banks O
, O
and O
developers O
of O
banking O
and O
money O
processing O
software O

. O

FIN7’s B-HackOrg
last O
campaigns O
were O
targeting O
banks O
in O
Europe O
and O
Central O
America O
. O

After O
a O
successful O
penetration O
, O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
uses O
its O
own O

and O
the O
CobaltStrike B-Tool
framework I-Tool

where O
it O
can O
monetize O
its O

AveMaria B-HackOrg
is O
a O
new O
botnet O
, O
whose O
first O
version O
we O
found O
in O
September O
2018 O
, O
right O
after O
the O
arrests O
of O
the O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
members O
. O

This O
threat B-HackOrg
actor I-HackOrg
stole O
suspected O
of O
stealing O
€13 O
million O
from O
Bank O
of O

, O
Malta O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
AveMaria O
is O
a O
classic O

from O
various O
types O
of O
software: O

, O
and O
can O
act O
as O
a O

. O

They B-HackOrg
also O
use O
AutoIT B-Tool
droppers I-Tool
, O
password-protected O

and O
even O

. O

To O
deliver O
their O

the O
cyber B-HackOrg

like O
CVE-2017-11882 B-Exp
, O
or O

. O

Interestingly O
, O
this O
actor B-HackOrg
targeted O
financial O
entities O
and O
companies O
in O
one O
African O
country O
, O
which O
lead O
us O
to O
think O
that O
CopyPaste O
was O
associated O
with O
cybermercenaries O
or O
a O
training O

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2018 O
, O
while O
searching O
for O
new O
FIN7 B-HackOrg
campaigns O
via O

, O
O
we O
discovered O
a O
set O
of O

that O
we O
temporarily O
called O
CopyPaste” O
from O
a O
previously O
unknown O
APT O
. O

FIN7 B-HackOrg

The O
second O
one O
is O
CobaltGoblin B-HackOrg
Carbanak B-HackOrg
EmpireMonkey B-HackOrg
, O
which O
uses O
the O
same O
toolkit O
, O
techniques O
and O
similar O
infrastructure O
but O
targets O
only O
financial O
institutions O
and O
associated O
software/services O

We O
observe O
, O
with O
various O
level O
of O
confidence O
, O
that O
there O
are O
several O
interconnected O
groups B-HackOrg
using O
very O
similar B-Tool
toolkits I-Tool
and O
the O
same O
infrastructure B-Tool
to O
conduct O
their O
cyberattacks O
. O

The O
last O
piece O
is O
the O
newly O
discovered O
CopyPaste B-HackOrg
group O
, O
who O
targeted O
financial O
entities O
and O
companies O
in O
one O
African O
country O
, O
which O
lead O
us O
to O
think O
that O
CopyPaste O
was O
associated O
with O
cybermercenaries O
or O
a O
training O
center O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2018 O
, O
the O
cluster B-HackOrg
started O
to O
use O
not O
only O
CobaltStrike B-Tool
but O
also O
Powershell B-Tool
Empire O
in O
order O
to O
gain O
a O
foothold O
on O
the O

continues O
to O
use O
effective O

with O
well-known O

MuddyWater B-HackOrg
is O
widely O
regarded O
as O
a O
long-lived O

in O
the O
Middle O
East O

From O
February O
to O
April O
2019 O
, O
MuddyWater B-HackOrg
launched O
a O
series O
of O
spear-phishing O
attacks O
against O
governments O
, O

in O
Turkey O
, O
Iran O
, O
Afghanistan O
, O
Iraq O

FIN7 B-HackOrg
thus O
continue O

in O

with O
well-known O
MS O

We O
also O
unearthed O
and O
detailed O
our O
other O
findings O
on O
MuddyWater B-HackOrg
, O
such O
as O
its O
connection O
to O
four O
Android B-Tool

and O
More O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
campaign O
used O
compromised B-Tool
legitimate I-Tool
accounts I-Tool
to O
trick O
victims O
into O
installing O
malware O
. O

Notably O
, O
the O
group’s B-HackOrg
use O
of O
email B-Tool
as O
infection O
vector O
seems O
to O
yield O
success O
for O
their O
campaigns O
. O

We O
also O
observed O
MuddyWater’s B-HackOrg
use O
of O
multiple O
open O

post-exploitation B-Tool
tools I-Tool
, O
which O
they O
deployed O
after O
successfully O
compromising O
a O

. O

The O

also O
connected O

that O
were O
linked O
to O

The O
main O

is O
usually O
Imminent O

however O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
2018 O
, O
we O
also O
observed O
the O
use O
of O
LuminosityLink O

, O
NetWire O
RAT O
, O
and O

. O

In O
a O
case O
in O
June O
2019 O
, O
we O
also O
noticed O

But O
with O
the O
West O
African O
gang O
we’ve O
named O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
, O
we O
have O
a O
deeper O
look O
at O
how O
business O
email O
compromise O
is O
connected O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
cybercrime O
. O

In O
a O
recent O
report O
, O
the O
FBI’s O
Internet O
Crime O

(IC3) O
reported O
that O
more O
than O
20 O
, O

lost O
nearly O
$1.3 O

This O
investigation O

named O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
offers O
unprecedented O
visibility O
into O
eleven O
years O
of O

activities O
, O
and O
the O
growth O
of O
a O

into O
a O

. O

While O
this O

that O

Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary’s I-HackOrg
fraudulent O
history O
can O
be O
traced O
as O
far O
back O
as O
October O
2008 O
, O
when O
the O
group B-HackOrg
first O
arrived O
on O
the O
cybercriminal O
circuit O
. O

By O
March O
2016 O
, O
one O
of O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary’s I-HackOrg
members O
had O
built O
enough O
trust O
with O
a O
romance O
victim—who O
we’ll O
call O
Jane—that O
she O
became O
a O
frequent O
source O
of O
new O
mule O
accounts O
for O
the O
group B-HackOrg
. O

Alpha’s B-HackOrg
early O
role O
was O
fairly O
simple: O
engage O
with O
individuals O
, O
who O
he O
chose O
based O
on O
the O
goods O
they O
were O
selling O
, O
and O
then O
provide O
personal O
shipping O
addresses O
back O
to O
Omega O
. O

By O
all O
accounts O
, O
late O
2015 O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
BEC O
for O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
. O

The O
first O
type O
of O
attack O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
pivoted O
to O
was O
credential O
phishing O
. O

Between O
July O
2015 O
and O
February O
2016 O
, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary’s I-HackOrg
primary O
focus O
seemed O
to O
be O
mass O
harvesting O
general O
credentials O
using O
a O
Google O
Docs O
phishing O
page O
. O

In O
the O
first O
few O
months O
of O
their O
credential O
phishing O
ventures O
, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary’s I-HackOrg
sights O
were O
mostly O
set O
on O
Asian O
targets—Malaysia O
and O
Japan O
, O
in O
particular O
. O

In O
November O
2015 O
, O
the O
group B-HackOrg
started O
to O
focus O
on O
North O
American O
users O
, O
mostly O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

This O
activity O
ceased O
in O
February O
2016 O
, O
likely O
because O
the O
men O
who O
made O
up O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
began O
to O
focus O
on O
honing O
their O
BEC O
skills O
. O
In O
total O
, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
received O
more O
than O
3 O
, O
000 O

as O
a O
result O
of O
their O
phishing B-Exp
attacks O
. O

For O
over O
eighteen O
months O
from O
March O
2017 O
until O
November O
2018 O
, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary’s I-HackOrg
frequent O
enterprise-focused O
credential O

campaigns O
almost O
exclusively O
targeted O
businesses O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Canada O
. O

In O
July O
2018 O
, O
following O
a O
trend O
we O
have O
observed O
across O
the O
entire O
BEC O
threat O
landscape O
, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
changed O
their O
preferred O
cash O
out O
mechanism O
from O

to O

Instead O
of O
using O
fake O
Google O

pages O
to O
collect O
personal O
email O

, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
began O
using O

of O
commonly O

to O
compromise O
enterprise O
credentials O
. O

Using O
personal O
information O
obtained O
from O
various O
sources O
, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
started O
perpetrating O
fraud O
against O
US O
federal O
and O
state O
government O
agencies O
. O

In O
total O
, O
35 O
actors O
have O
been O
tied O
to O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary’s I-HackOrg
operations O
since O
the O
group O
emerged O
in O
2008 O
. O

Just O
as O
with O
romance O
scams O
, O
O
actors B-HackOrg
make O
use O
of O
scripts B-Tool
and O
templates B-Tool
they O
can O
copy-and-paste O
without O
having O
to O
create O
something O
on O
their O
own O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
engaging O
targets O
, O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
frequently O
maximized O

through O
the O
use O
of O

or O
as O
some O

of O
the O

call O
them O

formats.” O
These O

are O
templated O
text O

that O
can O
contain O
several O
layers O
of O

to O
send O
to O
potential O
victims O

Recently O
, O
we O
unveiled O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
UEFI O
rootkit O
, O
called O
LoJax B-Tool
, O
which O
we O
attribute O
to O
the O
Sednit B-HackOrg
group O
. O

If O
Scattered B-HackOrg
Canary I-HackOrg
can O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
microcosm O
for O
the O
rapidly O
evolving O
organizations O
behind O
today’s O
most O
pernicious O
email O
scams O
, O
this O
report O
demonstrates O
that O
a O
much O
more O
holistic O
approach—one O
based O
on O
threat O
actor O
identity O
rather O
than O
type O
of O
fraudulent O
activity—is O
required O
to O
detect O
email O
fraud O
and O
protect O
organizations O
. O

This O
is O
a O
first O
for O
an O
APT O
group O
, O
and O
shows O
Sednit B-HackOrg
has O
access O
to O
very O
sophisticated B-Tool
tools I-Tool
to O
conduct O
its O
espionage O
operations O
. O

Three O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
Sednit B-HackOrg
group O
unleashed O
new O
components O
targeting O
victims O
in O
various O
countries O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
Central O
Asia O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
Sednit B-HackOrg
used O
a O
similar O
technique O
for O
credential O
phishing O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
August O
2018 O
, O
O
the O
Sednit O
group O
launched O
a O
spearphishing O
email O
campaign O
where O
it O
distributed O
shortened O
URLs O
that O
delivered O
the O
first O
stage O
of O
Zebrocy O
components O
. O

As O
we O
explained O
in O
our O
most O
recent O
blogpost O
about O
Zebrocy B-HackOrg
, O
the O
configuration O
of O
the O
backdoor B-Tool
is O
stored O
in O
in O
the O
resource O
section O
and O
is O
split O
into O
four O
different O
hex-encoded O

. O

The O
past O
iteration O
of O
SLUB B-HackOrg
spread O
from O
a O
unique O
watering O
hole O
website O
exploiting O
CVE-2018-8174 B-Exp
, O
a O
VBScript O
engine O
vulnerability O
. O

It B-HackOrg
used O
GitHub B-Tool
and O
Slack B-Tool
as O
tools O
for O
communication O
between O
the O
malware O
and O
its O
controller O
. O

On O
July O
9 O
, O
we O
discovered O
a O
new O
version O
of O
SLUB B-HackOrg
delivered O
via O
another O
unique O
watering O
hole O
website O
. O

This O
malicious O
site O
used O

discovered O
by O
Trend O
Micro’s O
Zero O

this O
April O
. O

Since O
we O
published O
out O
last O
report O
on O
SLUB B-HackOrg
, O
the O
backdoor B-Tool
has O
been O
updated O
and O
several O
improvements O
were O
implemented O
. O

The O
SLUB B-HackOrg
malware O
was O
delivered O
through O
watering O
hole O
websites O
that O
were O
injected O
with O
exploits O
for O
CVE-2018-8174 B-Exp
or O
CVE-2019-0752 B-Exp
. O

During O
this O
attack O
, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
SLUB B-HackOrg
malware O
used O
two O
Slack O
teams O
sales-yww9809” O

In O
April O
2018 O

In O
May O
2018 O
, O
campaigns O

the O

and O
its O
possible O
attribution O
, O
discovering O
a O
potential O
expansion O
of O
the O
TA505 B-HackOrg

. O

The O

, O
as O
stated O
by O

, O
leveraged O
a O
command O
and O
control O
server O
located O
in O

related O
to O
the O
TA505 B-HackOrg
actor: O
a O
very O
active O

all O
around O

, O
threatening O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
high O

The O
comparison O

The O
TA505 B-HackOrg
group O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
threat O
groups O
operating O
since O
2014 O
, O
it O
has O
traditionally O
targeted O
Banking O
and O
Retail O
industries O
, O
as O
we O
recently O
documented O
during O
the O
analysis O
of O
the O
Stealthy O
Email O
Stealer” O
part O
of O
their O
arsenal O
. O

Also O
, O
O
some O
code O
pieces O
are O
directly O
re-used O
in O
the O
analyzed O

, O
such O
as O
the O
i.cmd” O
and O

files O
, O
and O
, O
at O
the O

time O
, O
some O
new O

been O
introduced O
, O
for O

the O
rtegre.exe” O
and O
the O

In O
2018 O
, O
Kaspersky O
Labs O
published O
a O
report O
that O
analyzed O
a O
Turla B-HackOrg
PowerShell B-Tool
loader I-Tool
that O
was O
based O
on O
the O
open-source O
project O
Posh-SecMod O
. O

Turla B-HackOrg
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2008 O
, O
O
when O
it O
successfully O
breached O
the O
US O
military O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-HackOrg
has O
used O
PowerShell B-Tool
in-memory O
loaders O
to O
increase O
its O
chances O
of O
bypassing O
security O
products O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
the O
same O
scripts O
are O
used O
more O
globally O
against O
many O
traditional O
Turla B-HackOrg
targets O
in O
Western O
Europe O
and O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

In O
some O
samples O
deployed O
since O
March O
2019 O
, O
Turla B-HackOrg
developers O
modified O
their O
PowerShell O
scripts O
in O
order O
to O
bypass O
the O
Antimalware O
Scan O
Interface O
(AMSI) O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
research O
, O
SWEED B-HackOrg
— O
which O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 O
— O
primarily O
targets O
their O
victims O
with O
stealers O
and O
remote O
access O
trojans O
. O

It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
Turla B-HackOrg
operators O
used O
the O
free O
email O
provider O
GMX O
again O
, O
as O
in O
the O
Outlook B-Tool
Backdoor I-Tool
and O
in O
LightNeuron B-Tool
. O

This O
new O
research O
confirms O
our O
forecast O
and O
shows O
that O
the O
Turla B-HackOrg
group O
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
use O
open-source O
pen-testing O
frameworks B-Tool
to O
conduct O
intrusion O
. O

Neptun O
is O
installed O
on O
Microsoft O
Exchange O
servers O
and O
is O
designed O
to O
passively O
listen O
for O
commands O
from O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
. O

One O
attack O
during O
this O
campaign O
involved O
the O
use O
of O
infrastructure O
belonging O
to O
another O
espionage O
group O
known O
as O
Crambus B-HackOrg
aka O
OilRig B-HackOrg
, O
APT34 B-HackOrg
. O

Waterbug B-HackOrg
has O
been O
using O
Meterpreter B-Tool
since O
at O
least O
early O
2018 O
and O
, O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
used O
a O
modified O
version O
of O
Meterpreter B-Tool
, O
which O
was O
encoded O
and O
given O
a O
.wav O
extension O
in O
order O
to O
disguise O
its O
true O
purpose O
. O

In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
Waterbug’s B-HackOrg
use O
of O
Crambus B-Tool
infrastructure I-Tool
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
hostile O
takeover O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
things O
to O
occur O
during O
one O
of O
Waterbug’s B-HackOrg
recent O
campaigns O
was O
that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus O
espionage O
group B-HackOrg
and O
used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O
to O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O

These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
campaigns O
have O
seen O
the O
group B-HackOrg
compromise O
governments O
and O
international O
organizations O
across O
the O
globe O
in O
addition O
to O
targets O
in O
the O
IT O
and O
education O
sectors O
. O

Curiously O
though O
, O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
also O
compromised O
other O
computers O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
using O
its O
own O
infrastructure O
. O

Symantec O
believes O
that O
the O
variant O
of O
Mimikatz B-Tool
used O
in O
this O
attack O
is O
unique O
to O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
attack O
involving O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
, O
this O
sample O
of O
Mimikatz B-Tool
has O
only O
been O
seen O
used O
in O
one O
other O
attack O
, O
O
against O
an O
education O
target O
in O
the O
UK O
in O
2017 O
. O

The O
first O
observed O
evidence O
of O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
activity O
came O
on O
January O
11 O
, O
2018 O
, O
when O
a O
Waterbug-linked O
tool O
(a O
task O
scheduler O
named O
msfgi.exe) O
was O
dropped O
on O
to O
a O
computer O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
attack O
against O
the O
Middle O
Eastern O
target O
, O
Crambus B-HackOrg
was O
the O
first O
group O
to O
compromise O
the O
victim’s O
network O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
evidence O
of O
activity O
dating O
to O
November O
2017 O
. O

Waterbug’s B-HackOrg
intrusions O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
continued O
for O
much O
of O
2018 O
. O

Symantec O
did O
not O
observe O
the O
initial O
access O
point O
and O
the O
close O
timeframe O
between O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
observed O
activity O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
and O
its O
observed O
use O
of O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
suggests O
that O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
may O
have O
used O
the O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
as O
an O
initial O
access O
point O
. O
It O
also O
reconfigures O
the O
Microsoft O
Sysinternals O
registry O
to O
prevent O
pop-ups O
when O
running O
the O
PsExec B-Tool
tool I-Tool
. O

Waterbug B-HackOrg
also O
used O
an O
older O
version O
of O
PowerShell B-Tool
, O
likely O
to O
avoid O
logging O
. O

In O
one O
of O
these O
campaigns O
, O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
used O
a O
USB B-Tool
stealer I-Tool
that O
scans O
removable O
storage O
devices O
to O
identify O
and O
collect O
files O
of O
interest O
. O

The O
malware O
then O
uses O
WebDAV B-Tool
to O
upload O
the O
RAR O
archive O
to O
a O
Box O
account O

Kaspersky O
also O
observed O
some O

. O

Kaspersky O
wrote O
about O
LuckyMouse O
targeting O

Kaspersky O
also O
discovered O
that O
LuckyMouse O
unleashed O
a O
new O
wave O
of O
activity O
targeting O
Asian O
governmental O
organizations O
just O
around O
the O
time O
they O
had O
gathered O
for O
a O

Kaspersky O
have O
observed O
similar O
activity O
in O
the O
past O
from O
groups O
such O
as O
Oilrig B-HackOrg
and O
Stonedrill B-HackOrg
, O
which O
leads O
us O
to O
believe O
the O
new O
attacks O
could O
be O
connected O
, O
though O
for O
now O
that O
connection O
is O
only O
assessed O

In O
August O
2019 O
, O
FireEye O
released O

Finally O
, O
Kaspersky O
produced O
a O
summary O
report O
on O
Sofacy’s B-HackOrg
summertime O
activity O
. O

Kaspersky O
were O
also O
able O
to O
produce O
two O
reports O
on O
Korean O
speaking O
actors O
, O
specifically O
involving O
Scarcruft B-HackOrg
and O
Bluenoroff B-HackOrg
. O

Analysis O
of O
the O
payload O
allowed O
us O
to O
confidently O
link O
this O
attack O
to O
an O
actor O
Kaspersky O
track O
as O
BlackOasis B-HackOrg
. O

Kaspersky O
first O
became O
aware O
of O
BlackOasis’ B-HackOrg
activities O
in O
May O
2016 O
, O
while O
investigating O
another O

) O
, O
along O
with O
an O
executable O
( O
Update.exe O
) O
and O
DLL O
( O
McUpdate.dll O
) O
. O

We O
identified O
decoy O
files O
which O
indicate O
these O
attacks O
began O
with O
spear O
phishing O
messages O
but O
have O
not O
observed O
the O
actual O
messages O
. O

Additionally O
, O
these O
decoy O
documents O
are O
hosted O
on O
legitimate O
websites O
including O
a O
government O
website O
belonging O
to O
the O
Cambodia O
Government O
and O
in O
at O

, O
Facebook O
. O

However O
, O
the O
unique O
malware O
variant O
, O
BlackEnergy O

, O
reemerged O
in O
Ukraine O
early O
in O
2015 O
, O
where O
we O
had O
first O
found O
Sandworm B-HackOrg
Team I-HackOrg
. O

The O
initial O
indicator O
of O
the O
attack O
was O
a O
malicious O
web O
shell O
that O
was O
detected O
on O
an O
IIS O
server O
, O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
w3wp.exe O

. O

We O
have O
previously O
detected O
groups B-HackOrg
we O
suspect O
are O
affiliated O
with O
the O
North O
Korean O
government O
compromising O
electric O
utilities O
in O
South O
Korea O
, O
but O
these O
compromises O
did O
not O
lead O
to O
a O
disruption O
of O
the O
power O
supply O
. O


Instead O
, O
sensitive O
KHNP O
documents O
were O
leaked O
by O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
as O
part O
of O
an O
effort O
to O
exaggerate O
the O

they O
had O
and O
embarrass O
the O
South O
Korean O
Government O
, O
a O
technique O
we O
assess O
North O
Korea O
would O
turn O
to O
again O
in O

to O
instill O
fear O

To O

As O
we O
have O
noted O
in O
many O
earlier O
reports O
, O
attackers O
commonly O
use O
decoy O

to O
trick O
victims O
into O
thinking O
a O

is O
actually O
legitimate O

The O
documents O
attached O

used O
in O
both O
attacks O
contain O
code O
that O
exploits O
CVE-2012-0158 B-Exp
, O
which O
despite O
its O
age O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
Microsoft B-Exp

vulnerabilities I-Exp
being O
exploited O
by O
multiple O

actors O
. O

Even O
an O

can O
be O
fooled O
by O
downloading O
a O

adobe.com O
, O
since O
the O

the O

correspond O
to O
Adobe O

According O
to O
Deepen O

Bookworm B-Tool
's O
main O

controls O
all O
of O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
Trojan O
, O
but O
relies O
on O
the O
additional O
DLLs O
to O
provide O
specific O
functionality O
. O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks O
delivering O
Bookworm B-Tool
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
based O
on O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
associated O
decoys O

, O
as O
well O
as O
several O
of O
the O
dynamic B-Tool
DNS I-Tool

used O
to O
host O
C2 O
servers O
that O
contain O
the O
words O

. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date O
string O
hardcoded O
into O
each O
Bookworm B-Tool
sample I-Tool
as O
a O
build O
identifier O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date O
string O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date O
codes O
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-Tool
build O
identifier O
. O

Another O
decoy O
slideshow O
associated O
with O
the O
Bookworm O
attack O
campaign O
contains O
photos O
of O
an O

called O

If O
the O

, O
CVE-2013-3906 B-Exp
or O
CVE-2014-1761 B-Exp
) O
, O
then O
the O
document O
contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O
macros O
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe O
or O
AmmyySvc.exe O
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O

In O
addition O
to O
built-in O
functionalities O
, O
the O
operators O
of O
Careto O
can O
upload O
additional O

which O
can O
perform O
any O
malicious O
task O
. O

Careto O

Mask O
campaign O
we O
discovered O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing O
e-mails O
with O
links O
to O
a O
malicious O
website O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
attackers O
use O
sub-domains B-Tool
on O
the O
exploit O
websites O
, O
to O
make O
them O
seem O
more O
legitimate O
. O

We O
initially O
became O
aware O
of O
Careto O
when O
we O
observed O
attempts O
to O
exploit O
a O
vulnerability O
in O
our O
products O
to O
make O
the O
malware O
" O
invisible O
" O
in O
the O
system O
. O

The O
scanner O
was O
identified O
as O
the O
Acunetix O

Scanner O
which O
is O
a O
commercial O
penetration O

tool O
that O
is O
readily O
available O
as O
a O
14-day O

. O

The O
decoy O
documents O
dropped O
suggest O
that O
the O
targets O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
politically O
or O
militarily O
motivated O
, O
with O
subjects O
such O
as O

and O
political O
situations O
being O
used O
as O

documents O
. O

Lately O
, O
Patchwork B-HackOrg
has O
been O
sending O
multiple O
RTF O
files O
exploiting O
CVE-2017-8570 B-Exp
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A O
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O
attacks O
associated O
with O
a O
backdoor O
attack O
method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY B-Tool
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell B-Tool
) O
first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 O
in O
2013 O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B O
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A O
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-Tool
binary I-Tool
files I-Tool
. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B O
executable O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O
PowerPoint O
presentation O
, O
using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override O
( O
RTLO B-Tool
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false O
icon O
. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity O
have O
links O
to O
attacks O
with O
likely O
Indian O
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A O
attacks O
are O
linked O
to O
the O
use O
of O
SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL B-Tool
and O
the O
CONFUCIUS_B O
have O
a O
loose O
link O
to O
Hangover B-Tool
. O

The O
two O
malware O
families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O
technique O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O
single O
developer O
, O
or O
development O
company O
, O
behind O
both O
CONFUCIUS_A O
and O
CONFUCIUS_B O
. O

The O
Android O
version O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
can O
steal O
SMS O
messages O
, O

, O

For O
example O
, O
Bisonal B-HackOrg
malware I-HackOrg
in O
2012 O
used O

This O
particular O

in O
Russia O
and O
there O
is O
a O

If O
it's O

, O
the O
threat O
converts O
the O

. O

Bemstour O
is O

was O
rolled O
out O
in O
September O
2016 O

O
when O
it O
was O
used O
in O
an O

Bemstour O
was O
used O
again O
in O
June O
2017 O
in O
an O

Between O
June O

September O
2017 O
, O
O
Bemstour O
was O
also O
used O
against O

Development O
of O
Bemstour O
has O
continued O

The O

Proofpoint O

begin O
with O
the O

The O
basic O

include O

both O

As O
explained O
in O

the O

then O

As O

not O
yet O
observed O
this O

is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O

to O
the O

The O

In O
this O

we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
crime B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
that O
specializes O
in O
payment O
card O
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye O
Labs O
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising O
payment O
card O
processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate O
further O
card O
information O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group B-HackOrg
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-Tool
, O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove O
any O

of O
their O
operations O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them O
using O
virtual O
private O
network O
services O
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure O
anonymity O
and O
obfuscate O
criminal O
operations O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
group B-HackOrg
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group B-HackOrg
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email B-Tool
credentials I-Tool
, O
personal B-Tool
information I-Tool
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O

purposes O
. O

These O
actors B-HackOrg
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly O
access O

. O

The O
group B-HackOrg
also O
uses O
the O
SQL B-Tool

(SQLi) O
tools O
Havij O
Advanced O
SQL O
Injection O
Tool O
and O
SQLi O
Dumper O
version O
7.0 O
(Figure O

in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card B-Tool
credentials I-Tool
, O
these O
actors B-HackOrg
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate O
new O
card O
numbers O
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

The O
actors B-HackOrg
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create O
cloned O
physical O
cards O
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw O
funds O
from O
ATMs O
. O

The O
group B-HackOrg
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-Tool
606 I-Tool
Software I-Tool
(Figure O
12) O
and O
Hardware B-Tool
(Figure O
13) O
to O
create O
cloned O
cards O
. O

However O
, O
Brazilian O
actors B-HackOrg
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen O
cards O
in O
return O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
bill's O
value O
and O
reselling O
illicitly O
obtained O
goods O
. O

The O
individuals B-HackOrg
using O
Hancitor B-Tool
malware O
also O
known O
by O
the O
name O
Chanitor B-Tool
are O
no O
exception O
and O
have O
taken O
three O
approaches O
to O
deliver O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
ultimately O
steal O
data O
from O
their O
victims O
. O

Once O
downloaded O

executed O
, O
it O
drops O
an O

downloads O
a O

, O
which O
perform O
data O

After O
the O

is O
executed O
, O
O
it O
downloads O
Pony O

During O

we O
observed O
the O

Just O
a O
few O
months O
later O
, O
in O
February O
2015 O
, O
we O
announced O
the O
discovery O
of O
Carbanak B-Exp
, O
a O
cyber-criminal B-HackOrg
gang I-HackOrg
that O
used O
custom O
malware O
and O
APT O
techniques O
to O
steal O
millions O
of O
dollars O
while O
infecting O
hundreds O
of O
financial O
institutions O
in O
at O
least O
30 O
countries O
. O

Our O
investigations O
revealed O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
drove O
around O
several O
cities O
in O
Russia O
, O
stealing O
money O
from O
ATMs O
belonging O
to O
different O
banks O
. O

Utilizing O
KillDisk B-Tool
in O
the O
attack O
scenario O
most O
likely O
served O
one O
of O
two O
purposes O
: O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
covering O
their O
tracks O
after O
an O
espionage O
operation O
, O
or O
it O
was O
used O
directly O
for O
extortion O
or O
cyber-sabotage B-HackOrg
. O

The O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
Group I-HackOrg
's O
objective O
was O
to O
gain O
access O
to O
the O
target O
's O
environment O
and O
obtain O
key O
military O
program O
insight O
or O
steal O
money O
. O

Just O
last O
week O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
were O
found O
stealing O
millions O
from O
ATMs O
across O
Asia O
and O
Africa O
. O

The O
backdoors O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
are O
deploying O
are O
difficult O
to O
detect O
and O
a O
significant O
threat O
to O
the O
privacy O
and O
security O
of O
enterprises O
, O
allowing O
attackers B-HackOrg
to O
steal O
information O
, O
delete O
files O
, O
install O

, O
and O
more O
. O

Bankshot B-Tool
is O
designed O
to O
persist O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
network O
for O
further O
exploitation O
; O
thus O
the O
Advanced O
Threat O
Research O
team O
believes O
this O
operation O
is O
intended O
to O
gain O
access O
to O
specific O
financial O
organizations O
. O

The O
Leafminer B-HackOrg

that O

is O
looking O
for O
email O
data O
, O
files O
, O
and O
database O
servers O
on O
compromised O
target O
systems O
. O

Another O
intrusion O
approach O
used O
by O
Leafminer B-HackOrg
seems O
a O
lot O
less O
sophisticated O
than O
the O
previously O
described O
methods O
but O
can O
be O
just O
as O
effective O
: O
using O
specific O
hacktools B-Tool
to O
guess O
the O

for O

exposed O
by O
a O

While O
the O

not O
yet O
demonstrated O
an O

, O
RASPITE B-HackOrg

methodology O
are O
clear O
indicators O
of O
necessary O
activity O
for O
initial O

, O
especially O

The O
targeting O
of O
this O

suggests O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
are O
interested O
in O
breaching O
the O
French O
Ministry O

itself O

During O
a O

APT32 B-HackOrg
leveraged O
social O
engineering O
emails O
with O
Microsoft O

APT35 B-HackOrg
also O
installed O
BROKEYOLK O
, O
a O
custom B-Tool
backdoor I-Tool
, O
to O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
the O

. O

They O
then O
proceeded O
to O
log O
directly O
into O
the O
VPN O
using O
the O
credentials B-Tool
of I-Tool
the I-Tool
compromised I-Tool
user I-Tool
. O

Ultimately O
, O
APT35 B-HackOrg
had O
used O
access O
to O
hundreds O
of O
mailboxes O
to O
read O
email O
communications O
and O
steal O
data O
related O
to O
Middle O
East O
organizations O
, O
which O
later O
became O
victims O
of O
destructive O
attacks O
. O

The O
group B-HackOrg
has O
repeatedly O
used O
social O
media O
, O
particularly O
LinkedIn O
, O
to O
identify O
and O
interact O
with O
employees O
at O
targeted O
organizations O
, O
and O
then O
used O
weaponized O
Excel O
documents O
to O
deliver O
RATs B-Tool
such O
as O
PupyRAT B-Tool
. O

Sometimes O
, O
they O
aim O
at O
establishing O
a O

on O
the O
target O

to O
gain O
access O

Because O
some O

determining O
whether O

can O
be O
difficult O
. O

In O
2011 O
, O
three O
years O
after O
the O
most O
recent O
release O
of O
PIVY B-Tool
, O
attackers B-HackOrg

Attackers B-HackOrg
can O
point O

The O

However O
, O
based O

this O

we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O
actor O
's O
primary O
long-term O
mission O
is O
politically O
focused O
. O

The O
primary O
goal O
of O
these O

was O
likely O
to O
find O
code-signing O

A O
current O
round O
of O

from O

targeting O
the O

As O
recently O
as O
this O
past O
week O
, O
researchers O
observed O
Chinese O
hackers O
escalating O
cyber-attack O
efforts O
to O
steal O
military O
research O
secrets O
from O
US O
universities O
. O

The O
group O
has O
also O
targeted O
businesses O
operating O
in O
the O
South O
China O
Sea O
, O
which O
is O
a O
strategically O
important O
region O
and O
the O
focus O
of O
disputes O
between O
China O
and O
other O
states O
. O

Like O
many O
espionage O
campaigns O
, O
much O
of O
APT40 B-HackOrg
's O
activity O
begins O
by O
attempting O
to O
trick O
targets O
with O
phishing O
emails O
, O
before O
deploying O
malware O
such O
as O
the O
Gh0st B-Tool
RAT I-Tool
trojan I-Tool
to O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
a O
compromised O
network O
. O

The O
group O
used O
malware O
with O
keylogging O
capabilities O
to O
monitor O
the O
computer O
of O
an O
executive O
who O
manages O
the O
company O
's O
relationships O
with O
other O
telecommunications O
companies O
. O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O
group O
sought O
access O
to O
these O
networks O
to O
obtain O
information O
that O
would O
enable O
it O
to O
monitor O
communications O
passing O
through O
the O
providers' O
systems O
. O

Bahamut B-HackOrg
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android B-Tool
malware I-Tool
but O
running O
propaganda O
sites O
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities O
varied O
noticeably O
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut O
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate B-Tool
software I-Tool
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing O
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more O
passwords O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-HackOrg
's O
campaigns O
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O
or O
information O
operations O
– O
not O
destructive O
attacks O
or O
fraud O
. O

Once O
the O

they O
monitor O
the O
victim O

ultimately O
search O
for O

steal O
sensitive O

They O
have O
different O

the O

purpose O
— O
to O
steal O

At O
that O

— O
to O
the O

at O

$150,000 O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O

but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning O
off O

We O

the O

If O
an O
attacker B-HackOrg
was O
able O
to O
compromise O
an O

the O
attacker O
would O

We O
believe O
that O
the O

The O
zero-day O

At O

, O
we O
do O
not O

that O

found O
a O

We O
believe O

instead O
of O
the O

After O

it O

CVE-2018-0798 B-Exp

an O

As O

Analysis O

resulted O
in O
the O

utilizing O
CVE-2018-0798 B-Exp

These O

also O
suggest O
that O

the O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O

on O

the O
Trojan B-Tool
sends O
a O
static O

string O
to O
the O

that O
we O
referred O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date B-Tool
code I-Tool
to O
track O
their O
attack O
campaigns O
; O
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build O
identifier O
for O
the O
Trojan O
. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date O
string O
hardcoded O
into O
each O
Bookworm B-Tool

as O
a O
build O
identifier O

A O
Trojan O
sending O
a O
build O
identifier O
to O
its O
C2 O
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan O
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date O
string O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date O
codes O
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-Tool
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-Tool
samples I-Tool
use O
the O
static O
date O
string O
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O
attack O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
