other O
instances O
of O
PLATINUM B-HackOrg
attacking O

in O
India O
around O
August O
2015 O

In O
both O
these O

This O
section O
describes O
some O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
group B-HackOrg

The O
lack O
of O
any O

between O
any O
of O
these O
backdoor O
families O
is O
another O
clue O
as O
to O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
resources O
on O
which O
the O
activity B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
is O
able O
to O
draw O
, O
and O
the O
precautions O

able O
to O
take O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O

its O
espionage O
operations O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Dipsind B-Tool
and O
its O
variants O
, O
PLATINUM B-HackOrg
uses O
a O
few O
other O
families O
of O
custom-built B-Tool
backdoors I-Tool
within O
its O
attack O
toolset O
. O

The O
PLATINUM B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
has O
written O
a O
few O
different O
versions O
of O
keyloggers B-Tool
that O
perform O
their O
functions O
in O
different O
ways O
, O
most O
likely O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
different O
weaknesses O
in O
victims O
' O
computing O
environments O
. O

While O
one O
family O
relies O
on O
a O
small O
number O
of O
supported O
commands O
and O
simple O
shells O
, O
the O
other O
delves O
into O
more O
convoluted O
methods O
of O
injections O
, O
checks O
, O
and O
supported O
feature O
sets O
. O

Both O
groups B-HackOrg
can O
set O

Everyone O
, O
and O
work O
in O

with O
the O
PLATINUM B-Tool
backdoors I-Tool
. O

In O
particular O
, O
this O
second O
group B-HackOrg
also O
has O
the O
capability O
of O
dumping O
users O

credentials O
using O
the O
same O
technique O
employed O
by O
Mimikatz B-Tool

In O
addition O
to O
using O
several O
publicly O
known O
injection O
methods O
to O
perform O
this O
task O
, O
it O
also O
takes O
advantage O
of O
an O
obscure O
operating O
system O
feature O
known O
as O
hot O
patching O
. O

One O
of O
PLATINUM B-HackOrg
's O
most O
recent O
and O
interesting O
tools O
is O
meant O
to O
inject O

using O
a O
variety O
of O

techniques O
. O

At O
a O
high O
level O
, O

can O
transparently O
apply O

does O
not O
happen O
with O
traditional O
methods O
of O

such O
as O

is O
an O
operating B-Tool
system-supported I-Tool
feature I-Tool
for O
installing O
updates O
without O
having O

Multiple O
Dipsind B-Tool
variants O
have O
been O
identified O
, O
all O
of O
which O
are O
believed O
to O
be O
used O
exclusively O
by O
PLATINUM B-HackOrg

that O
Microsoft O
has O
designated O
Dipsind B-Tool
, O
although O
some O

The O
technique O
PLATINUM B-HackOrg

PLATINUM B-HackOrg
does O
not O
attempt O
to O
evade O
this O
requirement O

Even O
if O

We O
confirmed O
that O

but O
rather O
misused O

from O
the O
Hermes B-Tool

code O
and O
has O
been O
under O
steady O
development O

millions O

In O
August O
2017 O
, O
a O
new O
ransomware O
variant O
identified O
as O

reported O
to O
have O
ransomed O
the O
U.K. O

with O
a O
high O
ransom O

The O
targeting O
of O
an O
organization O
rather O
than O

, O
and O
the O
high O
ransom O
demands O
, O
made O
BitPaymer B-Tool
stand O
out O
from O

contemporary O

at O
the O
time O
. O

Though O
the O
encryption O
and O
ransom O
functionality O
of O
BitPaymer B-Tool
was O
not O
technically O
sophisticated O
, O
the O
malware O
contained O
multiple O
anti-analysis O
features O
that O
overlapped O
with O
Dridex B-Tool

Later O
technical O
analysis O
of O
BitPaymer B-Tool
indicated O
that O
it O
had O
been O
developed O
by O
INDRIK B-HackOrg
SPIDER I-HackOrg
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
had O
expanded O
its O
criminal O
operation O
to O
include O
ransomware O
as O
a O
monetization O
strategy O
. O

The O
beginning O
of O
2017 O
also O
brought O
a O
turning O
point O
in O
INDRIK B-HackOrg
SPIDER I-HackOrg
's O
operation O
of O
Dridex B-Tool
. O

CrowdStrike® O

also O
observed O
a O
strong O
correlation O
between O
Dridex B-Tool
infections O
and O
BitPaymer B-Tool

During O
incidents O
that O
involved O
BitPaymer B-Tool

Dridex B-Tool
was O
installed O
on O
the O
victim O
network O
prior O
to O
the O
deployment O
of O
the O
BitPaymer B-Tool

Also O
unusual O
was O
the O
observation O
that O
both O
Dridex B-Tool

Rocke O
was O
first O
reported O
by O
Cisco O
Talos O
in O

The O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
this O

it O
is O
more O

Recently O
, O
FireEye O
released O
a O
great O
report O
on O
one O
of O
the O
more O
active O
groups O
, O
now O
known O
as O
APT30 B-HackOrg

In O

, O
Kaspersky O
discovered O
that O
the O
Winnti B-HackOrg
group O
uses O
a O
popular O
backdoor O
known O
as O
PlugX B-Tool
which O
also O
has O
Chinese O

FireEye O
in O
October O
2014 O
suggests O
APT28 B-HackOrg
might O
be O
of O

origin O
. O

After O
publishing O
our O
initial O
series O
of O
blogposts O
back O
in O
2016 O
, O
Kaspersky O
has O
continued O
to O
track O
the O
ScarCruft B-HackOrg
threat O
actor O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
ScarCruft’s B-HackOrg
recent O
activities O
, O
Kaspersky O
strongly O
believes O
that O
this O
ScarCruft B-HackOrg
group O
is O
likely O
to O
continue O
to O
evolve O
. O

Kaspersky O
also O
discovered O
an O
interesting O
piece O
of O
rare O
malware O
created O
by O
this O

actor O
extensively O
testing O

In O
addition O
, O
Kaspersky O
analyzed O
the O

spotted O
an O
interesting O

of O
this O
campaign O
with O
another O
APT O

, O
which O
likely O
originates O
in O
the O
People O
. O

However O
, O
an O
investigation O
by O
Symantec O

found O
that O
Butterfly B-HackOrg

been O
active O
since O
at O

March O
2012 O
and O
its O

have O
not O

have O
also O
increased O
in O

. O

Talos O
assesses O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Group B-HackOrg
123 I-HackOrg

The O
targeting O

Specifically O
, O
the O
following O
facts O
support O
this O
assessment: O
The O
attacker B-HackOrg
targeted O
the O
SIS O
suggesting O
an O
interest O
in O
causing O
a O
high-impact O
attack O
with O
physical O
consequences O
. O

First O
, O
the O
attacker’s B-HackOrg
mission O
is O
to O
disrupt O
an O
operational O
process O
rather O
than O
steal O
data O
. O

The O
TRITON B-Tool
malware I-Tool
contained O
the O
capability O
to O
communicate O
with O
Triconex O
SIS O

. O

the O
attacker B-HackOrg
did O
not O
leverage O
all O
of O

We O
assess O
that O

We O
assess O
that O

likely O
compromised O

the O
primary O
goal O
of O

thousands O

around O
the O

In O
all O
three O
incidents O
, O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
gained O
access O

through O

of O
Citrix O

using O
stolen O

In O
early O
2017 O
, O
APT10 B-HackOrg
began O
conducting O
attacks O
against O
global O

providers O
(MSPs) O
that O
granted O
them O
unprecedented O
access O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
an O

malicious O
tool O
deployment O
on O
various O
Visma B-Tool
endpoints I-Tool
within O
two O
weeks O
of O
initial O

. O

They O
also O
used O
WinRAR O

, O
both O
often O
renamed O

to O
compress O
and O
upload O
the O
exfiltrated O

from O
the O
Visma B-Tool
network O

The O
attacker B-HackOrg
gained O

associated O
with O
low-cost O

The O
attackers B-HackOrg
used O
the O

method O
of O
lateral O

by O
mounting O
the O

on O
a O

, O
copying O

APT10's B-HackOrg
unprecedented O
campaign O
against O
MSPs O
, O
alleged O
to O
have O
included O
some O
of O
the O
largest O
MSPs O
in O
the O
world O
, O
in O
order O
to O
conduct O
secondary O
attacks O
against O

of O
hundreds O
(if O
not O
thousands) O
of O

around O
the O

. O

The O
malware O
basically O
provides O
a O
remote O
CMD/PowerShell B-Tool
terminal O
for O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
, O
enabling O
them O
to O
execute O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O
facade O
was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
attacks O
designed O
to O
steal O

spy O

are O
seemingly O
involved O
in O
the O
issue O
of O
migrants’ O

. O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
attackers B-HackOrg
may O
have O
impersonated O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
real O
young O

and O
stole O
her O
